            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgements unto Iſrael: he hath not dealt ſo with any nation; and as for his judgements they have not known them. <hi>He make's no mention of the Tabernacle, or Temple, the Ark of the Covenant, the altar of burnt-offering, the golden altar of incenſe, the Ordinance of Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>though in theſe they were priviledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Nations; but he ſingleth out this as a prime privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

And herein the ſingular goodneſs of God to this nation is much to be obſerved, not enely in viſiting it with the Goſpel for theſe laſt hundred years and more, but alſo in giving it the light of the Goſpel very early, even in the Apoſtles dayes.

               <p>In this age there were many Saints (ſuch as they were) of Royal, or Noble extraction: of theſe Noble Saints, St. <hi>Guthlake,</hi> a Benedictine Monk, was the firſt <hi>Saxon</hi> that profeſſed an Eremetical life in <hi>England;</hi> he was a Monk in the Abbey of <hi>Repyndon,</hi> and the third year after he went to <hi>Crowland,</hi> that is, the raw or crude Land, a fenny place in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and there led for a while an <hi>Anchoret's</hi> life, and there finally was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; in which Iſle and place of his burying, was built a fair Abbey.</p>
               <p>About the year 709. a Synod was aſſembled at <hi>Alnceſter</hi> in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> to promote the building of <hi>Eveſham</hi> Abbey; which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and the ſame was bountifully endowed by <hi>Offa,</hi> and other Mercian Kings, with large revenues: And not long after, another Synod was called at <hi>London,</hi> to introduce into <hi>England</hi> the doctrine of Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, now firſt beginning to appear in the publick practice of it.</p>

               <p>Then having ſet bounds to his Dominions, certain Comitial Lawes and Ordinances were made between them, enlarged and amplified by their Senators. Before all things they propoſed and preferred the ſtrict and holy worſhipping of Almighty God, and abandoning all barbarous Idolatry, next, they took care for the Enacting, Regiſtring, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling of Moral Laws, for containing of Subjects in their ſeveral duties, and due obedience, and therefore they firſt decreed, <hi>That the peace of the Church within her Walls (as it was then delivered by the hand of King</hi> Alfred) <hi>ſhould be piouſly and inviolably obſerved.</hi> They proceeded to the promotion and propagation of the Chriſtian Faith, and the abolition of all Paganiſm, and Heatheniſh Rites; for coertion of Clearks, and Men in Holy Orders, if they committed any Perjury, Fornication, or other Offences, or were unconformable in the celebration of Feſtival-days, times of Abſtinence, or other Orders and Injunctions of the Church; prohibiting Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſecular Negotiations upon the Lord's day. In all which the Impoſitions of Penalties and Puniſhments upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, and a <hi>Dane,</hi> were differenced one from the other. They alſo provided for the exilement of Witches, Wizzards, common Strumpets, and other lewd Creatures; with other good Laws for avoiding of Homicides, and for preſervation of Peace and Government, and maintenance of each Man's right of property in this their National commixture.</p>
               <p>This adjured League quieted the Civil diſcords of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> for the ſpace of four years, until the twelfth year of <hi>Alfred's</hi> Reign: And afterwards the continual inrode of the ſtragling unbaptized <hi>Danes</hi> iſſuing out of <hi>France,</hi> and other places (who vexed that Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern part of the Land) moleſted this good King untill his Death.</p>

The Regents in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and Readers in the Divinity-School, were <hi>Neoth,</hi> a worthy Divine, and <hi>Grimbald,</hi> well-skilled in Divinity: In Grammar and Rhetorick, the Learned <hi>Aſſerius,</hi> who wrote the life of this King: In Logick, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Arithmetick, the Reader was <hi>John,</hi> a Monk of St. <hi>Davids:</hi> In Geometry and Aſtronomy, read <hi>John</hi> a companion of <hi>Grimbald,</hi> a Man Witty and Learned; at which Lectures, this famous King <hi>Alfred</hi> was preſent. He gave many penſions to Scholars, Learned Men in all Arts, to inſtruct his Subjects in Religion, and all kinds of Learning: He contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to the relief of diſtreſſed Churches without his Realm: He protected his Realm from oppreſſion and injuſtice by his Sheriffs, Juſtices, and other Officers, whoſe proceedings he frequently examined, puniſhing them ſeverely when they had judged, or injured others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, out of Malice, Corruption, or Partiality: He divided the Day and Night into three parts; one eight hours he allowed himſelf for Eating, Drinking, Sleeping and Recreation; another eight hours he ſpent in hearing Cauſes, and in doing Juſtice; and the reſt of his time ſpent in Prayer, Reading the Scriptures, Meditation, and other pious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. And for the inſtructing his Subjects in the Holy Scriptures, he began to Tranſlate the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> himſelf, into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, but being prevented by Death, did not finiſh it: He gathered Pſalmes and Prayers together into a little Book, which he called a Manual, or Hand-book, which he always caried about him.

               <p>This King gave unto the Biſhops an entire Juriſdiction by themſelves to judge all cauſes relating to Religion, for before that time the Sheriff and Biſhop kept their Court together.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1160.

               <p>The King Commanded that Juſtice ſhould be executed upon all Men alike in his Courts: but <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> would have the Clergy (ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending) judged in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and by Men of their own Coat.

                  </gap>rench theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Clergy, the King called a Parliament at <hi>Clarendon</hi> near <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbury,</hi> to confirm the Antient Laws and Cuſtoms, to which <hi>Becket</hi> with the reſt of the Biſhops conſented and ſubſcribed them; but afterwards recanting his own Act, renounced the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſame year the King required to have puniſhment of ſome miſdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among the Clergy. The Archbiſhop would not permit; and when he ſaw (in his judgement) the Liberties of the Church trodden under Foot; he without the King's knowledge took Ship, and intended toward <hi>Rome;</hi> but by a contrary Wind he was brought back. Then he was called to account for his Receipts, that came to his hand while he was High-Chancellor. He appealeth to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> and, under pain
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53424:32"/> of Excommunication, forbad both Biſhops and Nobles to give Sentence againſt him, ſeeing he was both their Father and their Judge. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they, without his conſent, gave Sentence againſt him. Then he, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf forſaken of all the other Biſhops, lifted the Croſs which he held in his Hand aloft, and went away from the Court; and the next day got him over into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſo to the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> hath many Letters betwixt the Pope and this King, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſundry Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for reconciliation betwixt the King and the Archbiſhop, who abode ſeven years in exile. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> quarrelled with <hi>Roger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> for preſuming to Crown <hi>Henry</hi> the King's Son (made joint-King in the Life of his Father) a priviledge which <hi>Becket</hi> claimed as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to him alone. He ſolemnly reſigned his Archbiſhoprick to the Pope, as troubled in Conſcience, that he had formerly took it as illegally from the King; and the Pope again reſtored it to him, whereby all ſcruples in his mind were fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>But afterward by the Mediation of the French King, <hi>Becket</hi> had leave given him to return into <hi>England;</hi> howſoever the King ſtill retained his Temporals in his Hand, on weighty conſiderations, namely to ſhew their diſtinct Nature from the Spirituals of the Archbiſhoprick, to which alone they Pope could reſtore him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> returning into <hi>England</hi> Excommunicateth all the Biſhops, which had been at the Coronation of the young King. The King ſent, and required him to abſolve them, ſeeing what was done to them, was done for his Cauſe: but <hi>Thomas</hi> refuſeth.</p>
               <p>The next year after, he Excommunicated ſolemnly the Lord <hi>Sackvill</hi> appointed by the King, Vicar of the Church at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> becauſe he did derogate from the rights of the Church to pleaſe the King. He alſo Excommunicated one <hi>Robert Brook</hi> for cutting off an Horſes tail, that carried Victuals to the Archbiſhops Houſe.</p>
               <p>The King being then in <hi>Normandy,</hi> grieved very ſore before his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at the inſolent cariage of <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi> This moved Sir <hi>Richard Breton,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Morvil,</hi> Sir <hi>William Tracey,</hi> Sir <hi>Reginald Fitz-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſe,</hi> to return into <hi>England;</hi> and coming to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they found the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop in Cathedral Church, at three a Clock in the After-noon, and calling him Traytor to the King, they ſlew him, and daſhed his Brains upon the floor. His laſt words when he died, were, <hi>I commend my ſelf and God's Cauſe unto God, and to the bleſſed</hi> Mary, <hi>and to the Saints Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of this Church, and to St.</hi> Denis.</p>

The Pope writeth, in the behalf of <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> a froward and arrogant Letter, and not long after ſendeth a commandment and charge into <hi>England</hi> to certain Biſhops, that if the King would not yield, they ſhould Interdict his Realm.

No ſooner had they interdicted the Kingdom, but they with <hi>Joceline,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Bath,</hi> as ſpeedily, as ſecretly, fled out of the Land. And the King took all the poſſeſſions of thoſe Biſhops into his hands. He alſo proclaimed, that all thoſe that had Church-living, and went over the Sea, ſhould return at a certain day, or elſe loſe their Livings for ever: and charged all Sheriffs to enquire, if any Church-man received any Commandment that came from the Pope, that they ſhould apprehend them, and bring them before him, and alſo take into their hands for the King's uſe, all the Church-lands that were given to any man by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Stephen,</hi> or by the Priors of <hi>Canterbury</hi> from the time of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Now behold the miſery of King <hi>John,</hi> perplexed with the <hi>French</hi> King's daily preparation to invade <hi>England,</hi> aſſiſted by many Engliſh male-contents, and all the exil'd Biſhops.

               <p>King <hi>John</hi> out of his piety, to prevent profanations of the Lord's-day, removed the Market of the City of <hi>Exeter</hi> from the Lord's-day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was formerly kept, to the Monday.</p>
               <p>This King to ingratiate himſelf with the Romiſh Cardinals and Court, granted them annual Penſions out of his Exchequer, the Arrears where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ordered to be ſatisfied in the firſt place, and likewiſe gave Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Prebends to their Nephews and Creatures.

               <p>The turbulent Archbiſhop ſtirred up the Barons to a new Inſurrection, againſt the King, about their Liberties, who coming all to the King after <hi>Chriſtmas, Anno</hi> 1215. demanded the confirmation of their Charter, who craved time to adviſe thereon till after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the Archbiſhop and two more becoming his Sureties, that then he ſhould give ſatisfaction to all of them.

Whereupon the King appointed to treat with them at <hi>Running-mead,</hi> whither the Barons came with armed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes from all parts of the Realm, where after ſome parley, the King granted them their deſires, not only for their Liberties ſpecified in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta Forrestae,</hi> which he then ſealed, and by his Writs commanded to be put in due execution, but alſo that twenty five Peers elected by them (to whom all were ſworn to obey) ſhould force the King to obſerve theſe Charters (if ever he receded from them) by ſeizing all his Caſtles. <hi>Juratum eſt a parte Regis; Quod</hi> Anglicana <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia libera ſit, &amp;c.</hi> It was ſworn on the Kings part, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is free, and all men of our Kingdom, have and do hold all the foreſaid Liberties, Rights and Cuſtoms, well and peaceably, freely and quietly, fully and wholly to themſelves and their Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the Barons and Commons of the Realm then and afterwards taking the ſame Oath.

               <p>This Charter (though it ſaved a great part of the King's Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to petition him and his Heirs for Licenſes to elect, and for his Aſſent) gave a great wound to his Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy; and made all Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Covents, Biſhops, Monks, yea Popes and their Agents to ſlight his Regal Authority and Licenſes too, inſomuch that he could prefer no perſon to any Biſhoprick, Monaſtery, or elective Dignity, but whom the Electors pleaſed to make choice of.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53424:41"/> Agents gave the Archbiſhop a perſonal command to execute the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which he delayed to do, whereupon they ſuſpended him.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John</hi> complained to the Pope of the Barons obſtinacy, and how the Archbiſhop refuſed to Excommunicate them. Soon after there was a General Council held at <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the Archbiſhop was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, and there ſuſpended from his Archbiſhoprick upon the King's complaints againſt him. When this ſuſpenſion of the Archbiſhop was executed, the Pope commanded all his Suffragans and Subjects to diſobey him, till by his humiliation, and giving ſufficient caution for his future deportment, he ſhould demerit it.

               </p>
               <p>The Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York</hi> becoming void, the King, by his Letters Patents, granted the Chapter of <hi>York</hi> a Licenſe to elect a new Archbiſhop, in the preſence of five Commiſſioners therein ſpecially named, and with their conſents, to prevent the Election of <hi>Simon Langton,</hi> the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Brother, this being the firſt Licenſe after his forecited Charter to the Archbiſhop and Biſhops, for the freedom of Elections.

               <p>The Covent and Monks of <hi>Durham</hi> affronted King <hi>John</hi> in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Biſhop, whereupon he was enforced to make uſe of the Pope's and Legate's power, and yet could not effect his ends. But the Pope obtains His, to diſpoſe of all Elections and Biſhopricks at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The ſame year the King, with ſome ſtrugling, procured <hi>R. de Mariſco,</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> Yet we find not, in any of our Hiſtorians, that he was ever Conſecrated Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> notwithſtanding his Election, and the King's approbation, and Letters to the Pope's Legate on his behalf; ſo that, he miſcarried in this deſign, as he did in that of <hi>Hugh Foliot</hi> to St. <hi>Davids.</hi> Neither did he ſucceed in his recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three ſeveral Perſons to the Prior and Covent of <hi>Ramſey.</hi>

               <p>About that time <hi>Nigellus Vireker,</hi> a Learned Monk at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wrote a Book, <hi>De abuſu rerum Eccleſiae,</hi> and ſent it to <hi>William,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England.</hi> In this Book he not onely rebuked him, but all Teachers under the Pope's Tyranny: becauſe they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cure of Souls unto Children, Belly-gods, and deſpiſers of the Sacred Word</p>

               <p>About this time was taken an Impoſtor at <hi>Oxford</hi> having five wounds in his Body and Members, <hi>ſc.</hi> in his Side, Hands and Feet, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited himſelf to be Chriſt, with two Women his followers, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting themſelves to be the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Chriſt, and <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> They were immured together with him without any Victuals, and ſtarved to Death.</p>
               <p>Then was a Council held at <hi>Oxford</hi> under Archbiſhop <hi>Stephen,</hi> where many Conſtitutions were made, moſt of them being very uſeful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Extortions, Abuſes, Procurations in Viſitations, the taking of any Fees for Letters of Order, Funerals, or Adminiſtring any Sacrament, as alſo againſt Pluralities, Non-reſidence, and other abuſes of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

               <p>Then the Prior of St. <hi>Patrick</hi> of <hi>Dune</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſent a Petition to the King to grant him and others ſome ſmall Cell to reſide in, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> their Houſes in <hi>Ireland</hi> being frequently burnt in the Wars, for St. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s, and other Iriſh Saints ſake, whoſe Relikes he then ſent to the King for a preſent.</p>
               <p>The King to ſatisfie the Archbiſhop, wrote a Letter to the Pope, to give way for the return of his Brother <hi>Simon Langton</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> out of which he was formerly baniſhed (as well as Excommunicated, and deprived of all his Eccleſiaſtical Benefices) for adhering to <hi>Lewis,</hi> and contemning the Pope's Excommunications.

               <p>Our Kings by reaſon of their manifold Affairs in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> relating to the Pope and other Forreign States, uſually conſtituted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times general, otherwiſe ſpecial Proctors, by their Letters Patents, to implead and defend in their Names and Rights, all matters there depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for or againſt them, of which there are many different Formes in our Records.</p>

               <p>Then the Pope diſpatched <hi>Otto</hi> his Legate into <hi>England,</hi> with Letters to the King, for his own filthy lucre. The King aſſembling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Council of his Nobles and Prelates, <hi>Otto</hi> read the Pope's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Propoſals, wherein the deteſtable Avarice, Extortion, and Rapine of the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were clearly diſcovered, related by <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>

               <p>Upon his Death there grew a great difference between King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the Monks of <hi>Druham,</hi> about the election of a Succeſſor.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53424:45"/> There was an Appeal about this Election, pending before the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> before whom the King conſtituted his Proctor by Patent.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1228. died <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> after whoſe death there grew a new conteſt between the King and Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about the Election of a new Archbiſhop. The Monks choſe <hi>Walter de Heveſham,</hi> a Monk, whom the King refuſed to allow of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to make <hi>Richard,</hi> his Chancellor, Archbiſhop. <hi>Walter</hi> poſting to <hi>Rome</hi> to get Confirmation and Conſecration from the Pope, and the King's Proctors there excepting againſt him, preſſing the vacating of his Election, and making <hi>Richard</hi> Archbiſhop, with much importunity; they could not prevail with the Pope or Cardinals to ſtop <hi>Walter</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, or promote <hi>Richard,</hi> till they had promiſed, in the behalf of the King, unto the Pope, the tenths of all things moveable, from both his Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whereupon the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals forthwith vacated <hi>Walter</hi>'s Election, for his inſufficiency, and made <hi>Richard</hi> Archbiſhop. So the Pope got two years payment of his annual penſion, granted by King <hi>John,</hi> and a Tenth in promiſe.</p>
               <p>Yet where the King gave his Royal aſſent to Biſhops duly Elected by his Licenſe, where there was no competition, the Pope interpoſed not.</p>
               <p>This Archbiſhop <hi>Richard</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain againſt the King, that all affairs of his Kingdom were diſpoſed by the counſel of his chief Juſtice <hi>Hubert,</hi> when he had there accompliſhed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes againſt the King, was preſently taken away by ſudden Death.</p>
               <p>Then the King iſſued out a prohibition to the Monks of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> not to do any thing prejudicial to the rights of his Crown, nor to elect any Perſon Archbiſhop, without his ſpecial Licenſe, nor to ſend any Monks to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope's command, to Elect an Archbiſhop there.</p>
               <p>The Monks in purſuance of this Prohibition by the King's Licenſe, elected <hi>John</hi> their Prior Archbiſhop, whom the King by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

And the King to promote his Affairs the better in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> granted Annuities to ſome Cardinals to obtain that juſtice from them by ſuch Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which he could not procure without them. But yet the Pope vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ſecond election as well as the firſt. Hereupon the Monks proceed to a third election; but this third Perſon was alſo caſhiered by the Pope.</p>

                  <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> informs us, That <hi>Hubert de Burgo, Anno</hi> 1232. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> the King's principal faithful Counſellor, the greateſt oppoſer of the Pope's Uſurpations and Extortions, was, by the power of the Pope, and of <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all his Offices, and impeached of ſeveral Crimes, ſome of them amounting to high Treaſon. <hi>Hubert,</hi> to prevent the rage of his Enemies, fled to the Church of <hi>Merton,</hi> and there took Sanctuary. Whence the King commanded the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> by his Letters (the <hi>Londoners</hi> being his mortal Enemies) to pull him out forcibly, and bring him to him alive or dead. Which the Mayor and Citizens readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and marching thither with great Forces, the King, by the advice of the Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſuddenly countermanded them thence to their great diſcontent. After which <hi>Godfry</hi> of <hi>Cranecumb</hi> (whom the King ſent to apprehend him, in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> with three hundred men armed) finding the Chappel doors ſhut, violently brake them open, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hubert,</hi> and carried him thence, bound with cords, a priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This breach of Sanctuary being made known to <hi>Roger</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> (whoſe Dioceſs it was) he tells the King, that if the Earl were not reſtored to the Chappel, he would excommunicate all the Authors of that outrage. The Earl is accordingly reſtored, but the Sheriffs of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Hertford</hi> at the King's command, with the Powers of their Countreys, beſiege the Chappel ſo long, that at laſt the Earl was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to come forth, and render himſelf, bearing his affliction patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Hubert</hi> is again impriſoned in the Tower. Nothing could appeaſe the King's Ire, but that Maſs of Gold and other Riches, which the Knights Templers had in their cuſtody, upon truſt, which <hi>Hubert</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yielded up. This mollified the King's mind toward him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he had all ſuch Lands granted unto him, as either King <hi>John</hi> had given, or himſelf had purchaſed.

               <p>The Pope was grown ſo proud in this Age by his Uſurpations, that he would not vouchſafe to hear and admit the King's Proctors and Agents, ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> upon his urgent Affairs, without moſt humble ſuits and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications in his Letters of credence and procurations.</p>
               <p>The King made a Remonſtrance to the Pope of the ſeveral injuries done to him by the Earl of <hi>Britain,</hi> in ſeizing on his Caſtles, and revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King of <hi>France;</hi> deſiring the Pope by his Eccleſiaſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to compel him to reſtore his Caſtles to him.

               <p>In the 22th year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Greek Churches renounced all obedience to, and communion with, the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which made the Pope and his Court fear the like Schiſm and revolt in <hi>England,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Legat's violent Extortions, and advancement of Strangers to Benefices; whereupon he intended to recal him thence to prevent theſe ill conſequences; but the Legat loth to depart, prevailed with the King and others to ſollicit the Pope for his continuance in <hi>England,</hi> upon pretence of publick good.</p>

               <p>Some Abbots and Convents perceiving that <hi>Robert Groſthed,</hi> and other Biſhops, intended to vex and oppreſs them, by their new powers to viſit them, derived from the Pope, combined together to make a common purſe to oppoſe and withſtand them by Appeals to the Pope; whom they hoped would back them for Money, as the Biſhops combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together to withſtand the Archbiſhop's Viſitation in his Province.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53424:49"/> Notwithſtanding this combination, the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> proceeded to Viſit both the Monaſteries and Nunneries in his Dioceſs, with great ſeverity and Tyranny.</p>
               <p>But although <hi>Robert Groſthed</hi> at firſt was a great ſtickler for the Pope, and an oppreſſor of the Nobility and Laity of his Dioceſs, with his Viſitations, appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Excommunications; yet afterwards he oppoſed the Pope's Proviſions directed to him, for which the Pope ſuſpended him from his Biſhoprick: Whereupon he ſent a notable Letter to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> rendring him the reaſons why he was not bound to obey his unjuſt Letters and Proviſions, as moſt contrary to the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, tending to the ruine of Peoples Souls; and that no Biſhop or other Perſon was bound to obey any of the Pope's Mandates as Apoſtolical, but what were warranted by the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The Letter is to be ſeen at large in Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s late Hiſtory of Pope's Uſurpations, <hi>&amp;c. Tom.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>A little before his death, this <hi>Robert Groſthed</hi> called ſome of his Clergy to him, and by ſtrong reaſons and arguments informed them, <hi>That the Pope was Antichriſt, becauſe he was a deſtroyer of Souls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> gives this character of him; <hi>Migravit ab hujuſmode mundi, quem nunquam dilexit, exilio, ſanctus</hi> Lincolnienſis <hi>Epiſcopus,</hi> Robertus <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, apud</hi> Bugedonam, <hi>manerium ſuum, in nocte ſancti</hi> Dionyſii, <hi>Papae &amp; Regis Redargutor manifeſtus, Praelatorum correptor, Monarchorum corrector, Presbyterorum director; Clericorum inſtructor, Scholarium ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentator; Populi praedicator; Incontinentium perſecutor; Scripturarum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus perſcrutator diverſarum;</hi> Romanorum <hi>malleus &amp; contemptor; in menſa refectionis corporalis dapſilis, copioſus &amp; civilis, hilaris &amp; affabilis: in menſa vero spirituali devotus, lacrymoſus &amp; contritus: in officio Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificali ſedulus, venerabilis, &amp; indefatigabilis.</hi>

               <p>It is charged on this King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, that he ſuffered the Pope to encroach on the Dignity of the Crown. His Father had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome of his Priviledges from the Papal uſurpation; which, ſince, his Son had loſt back again.</p>

               <p>Twelve men were appointed to manage the Affairs of the Kingdom during the King's minority: the Archbiſhop's of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York:</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Winchester, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter; Thomas Brotherton</hi> Earl <hi>Marſhal, Edmond</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent, John</hi> Earl <hi>Warren, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Wake, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Piercy, Oliver</hi> Lord <hi>Ingham,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Roſs:</hi> but the Queen, and <hi>Roger</hi> Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> uſurped this charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam Tarlton</hi> was accuſed of Treaſon in the beginning of the Reign of this King, and arraigned by the King's Officers, when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King he thus boldly uttered himſelf.
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lord the King, with all due reſpect unto your Majeſty, I</hi> Adam, <hi>an humble Miniſter, and Member of the Church of God, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Biſhop, though unworthy; neither can, nor ought to anſwer, unto ſo hard Queſtions, without the connivance and conſent of my Lord Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>my immediate Judge under the Pope, and without the conſent of other Biſhops who are my Peers.</hi>

               <p>Three Archbiſhops were there preſent in the place, <hi>Canterbury, York,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> by whoſe Interceſſion <hi>Tarlton</hi> eſcaped at that time. Not long after he was arraigned again at the King's Bench: whereupon the foreſaid Archbiſhops ſet up their Croſſes, and with ten Biſhops more.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53424:64"/> attended with a numerous Train of well-weaponed Servants, advanced to the place of Judicature. The King's Officers frighted at the ſight, fled away, leaving Biſhop <hi>Tarlton</hi> the priſoner alone at the Bar: whom the Archbiſhops took home into their own cuſtody, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Curſe upon all ſuch who ſhould preſume to lay violent hands upon him.</p>
               <p>The King offended hereat, cauſed a jury of Lay-men to be impannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and to enquire according to form of Law, into the Actions of the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford.</hi> This was the firſt time that ever Lay-men paſſed their verdict upon a Clergy-man. Theſe Jurors found the Biſhop guilty, whereupon the King ſeized his Temporalties, proſcribed the the Biſhop, and deſpoiled him of all his moveables. But afterwards he was reconciled to the King, and by the Pope, made Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> where he died.</p>
               <p>The former part of this King's Reign affordeth but little Church-hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as wholly taken up with his Atchievements in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> where his ſucceſs by Sea and Land was to admiration. He had both the Kings he fought againſt, <hi>viz. John de Valois</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his priſoners, at one time, taken by fair Fight in open Field.</p>
               <p>There was granted to the King of <hi>England,</hi> for theſe Wars, a Fifteenth of the Temporalty, a Twelfth of Cities and Boroughs, and a Tenth of the Clergy, in a Parliament holden at <hi>London.</hi> And afterwards in a Parliament at <hi>Northampton</hi> there was granted him, a Tenth peny of Towns and Boroughs, a Fifteenth of others, and a Tenth of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. All ſuch Treaſure as was committed to Churches throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the holy War, was taken out for the King's uſe in this:</p>
               <p>The next year after, all the Goods of three Orders of Monks, <hi>Lombards, Cluniacks,</hi> and <hi>Ciceſtercians,</hi> are likewiſe ſeized into the King's hands, and the like Subſidy as before, granted at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> Now the <hi>Cavrſines,</hi> or <hi>Lombards,</hi> did not drive ſo full a trade as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereupon they betook themſelves to other Merchandiſe, and began to ſtore <hi>England</hi> with Forreign Commodities, but at unreaſonable rates, whilſt <hi>England</hi> it ſelf had as yet but little and bad Shipping, and thoſe leſs employed.</p>
               <p>About this time the Clergy were very bountiful in contributing to the King's neceſſities, in proportion to their Benefices. Hereupon a Survay was exactly taken of all their Glebeland, and the ſame (fairly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fuller.</hi> Church Hiſtory.</note> engroſſed in Parchment) was returned into the Exchequer, where it remaineth at this day, and is the moſt uſeful Record for Clergy-men (and alſo for Impropriators as under their claim) to recover their right.</p>
               <p>It was now complained of, as a grand grievance, that the Clergy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As for Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies into Forreign parts, Noblemen were employed therein: when <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> not <hi>Experience</hi> was required thereunto, and <hi>Ceremony</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Service: otherwiſe when any difficulty in Civil Law, then Clergy-men were ever entertained. The Lord Chancellor was ever a Biſhop, yea, that Court generally appeared as a Synod of Divines, where the Clerks were Clerks as generally in Orders.

               <p>In the mean time the Pope beſtirred him in <hi>England,</hi> while the King was buſied about his Wars in <hi>France:</hi> ſo that before Livings were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void, he pre-provided Incumbents for them. But at laſt the King looking into it, this <hi>Statute of Proviſion</hi> was made, whereby ſuch fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling of Livings to Forreigners was forbidden.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe of the King's diſpleaſure with the Pope, was, that when the Pope created twelve Cardinals at the requeſt of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he denied to make one at the deſire of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Papal party (notwithſtanding this Law of Proviſion) ſtrugled for a time, till the King's Power overſwayed them. Indeed this grievance continued, all <hi>this,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>next</hi> King's Reign, till the Statute of <hi>praemunire</hi> was made: and afterward the Land was cleared from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance of ſuch proviſions.</p>
               <p>Three years after the Statute, againſt the Pope's Proviſions, was made, the King preſented unto the Pope <hi>Thomas Hatlif,</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> one who was the King's Secretary, but one void of all other Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He complaineth of the unmarried Prieſts committing wickedneſs, and by bad example provoking others; of Images in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53424:65"/> Churches as Idolatry; of falſe Paſtors, which feed upon their flocks, and feed them not, nor ſuffer others to feed them. He wrote alſo againſt Purgatory.</p>

               <p>The King though courteous, was not ſervile to the Pope, and the Clergy terrified with the wavering doubtfulneſs of the King, granted him a tenth every year for diverſe years.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, his Son, ſucceeded in the Kingdom.

               <p>The Archbiſhop Cited him to appear before him at the Caſtle of <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and becauſe he appeared not, he Excommunicated him. Then the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> wrote a draught of the Confeſſion of his Faith, and Sealed it with his own Hand, in which he anſwered the four chiefeſt Articles that the Archbiſhop laid againſt him; and that done, he took the Copy with him, and went therewith to the King, who would not receive it, but commanded it to be delivered to thoſe who ſhould be his Judges. Then he deſired in the King's preſence, that an hundred Knights and Eſquires might be ſuffered to come, as upon his Purgation, which he knew would clear him of all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he offered himſelf, after the Law of Armes, to fight for Life, or Death, with any man living, Chriſtian, or Heathen, in the quarrel of his Faith, the King's Majeſty and the Lords of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil excepted: and furthermore proteſted, <hi>That he would obey all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Laws agreeable to the Word of God:</hi> yet for all this, the King ſuffered him to be ſummoned perſonally in his own Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</p>

                  <hi>Anno 1437.

               <p>The ſame month, with the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> died <hi>Henry Beanfort,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and Cardinal.

               <p>About the year 1453. began the broyls to break out out between the two Houſes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> ſo mutually heightened, that ſcarce a County betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> but a ſet Battel hath been fought therein, beſides other Counties in the Marches of <hi>Wales:</hi> beſides many other Skirmiſhes (Corrivals with Battels) ſo that ſuch, who conſider the blood loſt therein, would admire <hi>England</hi> had any left.

               <p>In the midſt of theſe Civil wars, <hi>William,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Patin</hi> from his Parents, but <hi>Wainfleet,</hi> from the place of his Nativity, now Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> founded the fair Colledge, dedicated to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> for one Preſident, forty Fellows, thirty Demies, four Chaplains, eight Clerks, and ſixteen Choriſters.

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> being conquered in a fatal Battel at <hi>Touton</hi> in <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> fled with his Queen into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to make himſelf the more welcome, reſigned <hi>Berwick</hi> to the King thereof. <hi>Edward,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> reigned in his ſtead.

                  <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ſucceeded his Father. On <hi>June</hi> 3.

               <p>Cruelty ſtill increaſed on the poor <hi>Lollards</hi> (as they were called) after abjuration forced to wear the faſhion of a Faggot wrought in thread, or painted on their ſleeves as long as they lived, it being death to put on their clothes without that cognizance. Their caſe was ſad, if they put it off, they muſt be burned, if they put it on, they muſt be ſtarved; for none generally would ſet them on work that wore that badge. On this account were <hi>William Sweeting,</hi> and <hi>James Brewſter</hi> re-impriſoned. In vain did <hi>Brewſter</hi> plead, that he was commanded to leave off his badge, by the Controller of the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s houſe.

               <p>Being to found two Colledges, he ſeized on forty ſmall Monaſteries, turning their Inhabitants out of Houſe and home, and converting their means principally to a Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi> This alienation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, ſo that in ſome ſort the Pope may thank himſelf for the demoliſhing of Religious houſes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

And therein every man was required to depoſe the true value of their Eſtates; and then of every fifty pounds there was demanded four ſhillings in the pound. And in <hi>London</hi> he made himſelf the chief Commiſſioner, The like Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he granted forth againſt all the Clergy of the Land, of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded four ſhillings in the pound of all their livings.</p>
               <p>Theſe things grieved the Clergy and Common People at the heart. The Cardinal perceiving this, recalled thoſe Commiſſions, and ſent forth others, which alſo being not endured, the King by his Letters directed into every County, commanded a preſent ceſſation of all executions of the ſaid Commiſſions, and proteſted they were granted forth without his knowledge or conſent. But, if they would by way of a Benevolence, of their own accord, enlarge themſelves towards him, he would take it as an infallible proof of their love toward him.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal now reſolved to revenge himſelf on the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, for not doing him right, and improving his power in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him to the Papacy, according to his promiſes, and intends to ſmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The buſineſs is brought into the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be decided by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh. But the Pope at this time was a priſoner to the Emperor, who conſtantly kept a guard about him: Yet after ſome delay, the Pope diſpatched a Commiſſion to two Cardinals, <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> and <hi>Campegius,</hi> an Italian, to hear and determine the matter at <hi>London.</hi> The Pope draws back the cauſe unto himſelf, and the King being impatient, having the conſent of both Univerſities, as alſo of that of <hi>Paris,</hi> he forſaketh <hi>Katharine,</hi> and Marrieth <hi>Anna Bolen, Anno</hi> 1533.</p>
               <p>And in the year 1534. he denieth obedience to the Pope, and chargeth all his Subjects, that they ſend no Money unto <hi>Rome,</hi> nor pay <hi>Peter-pence</hi> unto any of the Collectors, which vexeth the Roman Court.</p>
               <p>Then he publiſhed an Edict, whereby he declares himſelf under Chriſt, <hi>The ſupreme Head of the Church of</hi> England, and chargeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Death, that no man aſcribe any Power to the Pope within

Theſe things were confirmed by the Parliament, who alſo enacted, <hi>That the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>ſhould inveſt all the Biſhops of</hi> England, <hi>and that the Church-men ſhall pay to the King yearly one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for defence of the Kingdom.</hi>

                  <hi>Wolſey</hi> was accuſed in Parliament for exerciſing his power Legantine without leave, to the prejudice of the King's Crown and dignity. Mr. <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Servant to the Cardinal, being a Burgeſs, defendeth his Maſter: yet were all his goods of ineſtimable value confiſcated to the King and he outed of moſt of his Eccleſiaſtical promotions.

               <p>Then <hi>John Fiſher,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was impriſoned for refuſing the Oath of Supremacy. The Clergy in the Province of <hi>York</hi> did a long time deny the King's Supremacy. <hi>Edward Lee,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> fomented this difference.

               <p>The King wrote a fair and large Letter to the Convocation of <hi>York,</hi> claiming nothing more than what Chriſtian Princes in the Primitive times aſſumed to themſelves in their own Dominions, ſo that it ſeems he wrought ſo far on their affections, that at laſt they conſented thereunto.</p>

               <p>After the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> was made (which did much reſtrain the Papal power, and ſubject it to the Laws of the Land) Archbiſhops called no more Convocations by their ſole and abſolute command, but

               <p>Soon after by little and little began the ruine of the Abbeys and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Houſes, for all Religious Houſes, whoſe poſſeſſions in yearly revenue exceeded not the ſum of two hundred pounds, were ſuppreſſed and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and all their Sites and Poſſeſſions whatſoever were given for ever to the King.

               <p>Theſe proceedings of the King and Clergy againſt the Pope and Holy Church, were ſo generally diſliked by the rude and ignorant people, that they openly affirmed, that the King's Council irreligiouſly directed him amiſs, and that the temporizing Clergy of the Land practiſed by all means poſſible, to extinguiſh all Devotion, and utterly to ſubvert all the ancient Rites, Ceremonies, and commendable Government of the Church. And the unruly people in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> to the number of twenty thouſand, aſſembled themſelves in Arms, taking upon themſelves to frame better Orders for the governing of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

               <p>Now the King waxed more abſolute in his Government, eſpecially concerning his Clergy, and the ordering of the Church.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53424:84"/> moneys were formerly paid to the Pope, who had his Collectors in every Dioceſs, which ſometimes by Bills of Exchange, but generally in <hi>ſpecie</hi> (to the great impoveriſhing of the Land) yearly returned the Tenths and Firſt-fruits of the Engliſh Clergy to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>The Pope being now dead in <hi>England,</hi> the King was found his Heir at Common Law, as to moſt of the power and profit the other had uſurped.

               <p>This work took up ſome years in the effecting thereof; <hi>Devon-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Sommerſet</hi> were done in the twenty ſeventh; <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Counties, in the thirty fourth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and moſt of <hi>Wales</hi> not till the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.

Yet were not all alike criminal, for ſome Societies behaved themſelves ſo well, as their life being not only exempt from notorious faults, but their ſpare times beſtowed in writing Books, Painting, Carving, Graving, and the like Exerciſes, their Viſitors became Interceſſors for them.

               <p>Theſe his acquirements, by induſtry, were very much enriched and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by many excellent Endowments of nature; for in diſpoſition he was mild, gratious, and pleaſant, of an heavenly wit; in Body beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but eſpecially in his Eyes, which ſeemed to have a Starry livelineſs and luſtre in them.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53424:88"/> when <hi>Joan Butcher</hi> was to be burned, all the Council could not procure him to ſet his hand to the Warrant: wherefore they employed <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to deal privately with him for his ſubſcription.

               </p>
               <p>Then the Profeſſors of the Goſpel were in all places relieved, and many Priſoners appointed to die, were enlarged and preſerved: Onely <hi>Thomas Dobby,</hi> Fellow of St. <hi>John</hi>'s in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> committed to the Counter in <hi>Bred-ſtreet,</hi> and condemned for ſpeaking againſt the Maſſe, died of a natural death in Priſon; his ſpeedy death prevented the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which the Lord Protector intended to ſend him.</p>
               <p>The Lord Protector ordered all in Church and State.

Which done, they delivered to Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> a Copy of the Injunctions forementioned, together with the Homilies ſet forth by the King's authority, received by him with proteſtation, <hi>That he would obſerve them, if they were not contrary to the Law of God, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church.</hi> But afterwards he revoked his proteſtation, and humbly ſubmitted himſelf to his Majeſties pleaſure.

               <p>During the ſhort time of his reſtraint (<hi>viz.

And of this Act ſuch uſe was made, that the Biſhops of thoſe times were not in a capacity of conferring Orders, but as they were thereunto impowered by ſpecial Licenſe. The Tenour whereof was (if <hi>Sanders</hi> may be believed) in theſe words following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>The King to ſuch a Biſhop, Greeting. Whereas all and all manner of Juriſdiction, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, flows from the King, as from the Supreme Head of all the Body <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We therefore give and grant to Thee full Power and Licenſe, to continue during our good pleaſure, for holding Ordination within thy Dioceſs of <hi>N.</hi> and for promoting fit perſons unto holy Orders, even to that of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</q>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> cauſed this Act to be repealed in the firſt year of her Reign, leaving the Biſhops to depend on their former Claim, and to Act all things which belonged to their Juriſdiction in their own Names, and under their own Seals, as in former times. In which eſtate they have continued without any legal interruption from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Nicholas Ridley</hi> was promoted to the See of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> to which he had been nominated by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, a man of great Learning, and well-ſtudied in the Fathers, and an excellent Preacher. Doctor <hi>Barlow</hi> was preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners authorized to take away Images out of Churches, were in many places entertained with contempt and railing, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they went from <hi>London</hi> the worſe they were handled: one of them called <hi>Body,</hi> as he was pulling down Images in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> was ſtabbed in the body by a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Many there were that then cried down all the obſervations of Days and Times, and particularly of keeping <hi>Lent:</hi> complaint whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> in a Letter to the Lord Protector, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was ſent out commanding all people to abſtain from Fleſh in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> and the King's Lenten dyet was ſet out, and ſerved as in former times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hugh Latimer</hi> having by the power of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his favour with the King, been made Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter, Anno</hi> 1535. continued in that See, till on the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1539. he choſe rather to reſign the ſame,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53424:90"/> than to have any hand in paſſing the ſix Articles, then agitated in the Convocation, and confirmed by Parliament: full eight years he betook himſelf to the retiredneſs of a private life. On New-years day he Preached his firſt Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs (the firſt I mean after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion to his former Miniſtry) and two Lords-days after again in the ſame place, and on <hi>January</hi> 25. ſuch multitudes flocked to hear his Sermon, that being to Preach before the King the firſt Friday in <hi>Lent,</hi> a pulpit was placed in the King's privy Garden, where he might be heard of four times as many Auditors, as could have thronged into the Chappel. Which as it was the firſt Sermon that was Preached in that place, ſo afterward a fixed and ſtanding Pulpit was erected for the like occaſions, eſpecially for Lent-ſermons on the Sundays in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and hath ſo continued ever ſince till theſe latter times.</p>
               <p>At the return of the King's Commiſſioners, diſpatched throughout the Realm, to take a Survay of all Colledges, Free-chappels, Chanteries, and Brotherhoods, in the firſt place (as lying neareſt) came in the free Chappel of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> originally founded in the Palace at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and reckoned for the Chappel Royal of the Court of <hi>England.</hi> The whole Foundation conſiſted of thirty eight perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> one Dean, twelve Canons, thirteen Vicars, four Clerks, ſix Choriſters, beſides a Verger, and one that had the charge of the Chappel. This Chappel hath been ſince fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and employed for an houſe of Commons in all times of Parliament.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo fell the Colledge, commonly called St. <hi>Martins le Grand,</hi> near <hi>Alderſgate</hi> in <hi>London:</hi> the King gave the ſame, with the Liberties and precincts thereof to the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Theſe two, St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s and St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s, were the richeſt of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Then the Lord Protector being unfurniſhed of a Palace proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Greatneſs, doubted not to find room enough upon the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> lately erected, to raiſe a Palace equal to his vaſt deſigns. Which coming to the ears of <hi>Benſon,</hi> the laſt Abbot, and firſt Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> he was willing to preſerve the whole; by parting for the preſent with more than half of the eſtate belonging to it. And thereupon a Leaſe is made of ſeventeen Mannors, and good Farmes, lying almoſt altogether in the County of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> for the Term of ninety nine years, which was preſented to the Lord <hi>Thomas Seymor,</hi> to ſerve as an addition to his Mannor of <hi>Sudley.</hi> Another preſent of almoſt as many Mannors, lying in the Counties of <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> was made for the like Term to Sir <hi>John Maſon,</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>at that time invaded the profits of the Church, leaving the Title onely to the Incumbent; and that Chantery Prieſts were put by them into ſeveral Cures, to ſave their penſions; that many Benefices were laid out in Fee-farmes, and for making of Gardens: and finally, that the poor Clergy being kept to ſome ſorry pittances, were forced to put themſelves into Gentlemens houſes, and there to ſerve as Clerks of the Kitchin, Surveyours, Receivers,</hi> &amp;c. All which Enormities, were generally connived at by the Lords and others, who onely had the power to reform the ſame, becauſe they could not queſtion thoſe who had ſo miſerably invaded the Churches patrimony, without condemning of themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> having long lain Priſoner in the Fleet was enlarged, and permitted to return to his Dioceſs, where contrary to the promiſe made at his enlargement, he ſhewed himſelf croſs to the King's proceedings in caſe of Images and other things, that he was ſent Priſoner to the Tower, where he abode till he was ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the King's great care to ſet forth one uniform order of Adminiſtring the holy Communion in both kinds, yet among the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Prieſts and Miniſters of Cathedral and other Churches in this Realm, there aroſe variety of Factions in Celebrating the Communion Service, and Adminiſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion of the Sacraments, and other Rites of the Church. Some followed the Order of the King's proceedings: others patchingly uſed ſome part of them onely: but many cauſeleſly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them all, would ſtill continue in their former Popery. Moreover, many of thoſe who had been licenſed, appeared as active in Preaching againſt the King's proceedings, as any of the unlicenſed Preachers had been found to be. Which being made known to the King, and the Lords of the Council, it was adviſed, that a publick Liturgy ſhould be drawn, and confirmed by Parliament, which was done, <hi>An.</hi> 1548. and in the next year a penalty was impoſed by Act of Parliament on ſuch who ſhould deprave, or neglect the uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The King cauſed thoſe Godly Biſhops, and other Learned Divines (whom he had form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rly imployed in drawing up the order for the holy Communion) to frame a publick Liturgy, containing the order of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening Prayer, together with a Form of Miniſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and for the celebrating of all publick Offices in the Churches.</p>
               <p>This was done accordingly: Some exception being taken at it by Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> abroad, and ſome zealots at home, the Book was brought
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53424:91"/> under a review, and by Statute in Parliament, it was appointed, it ſhould be faithfully peruſed, explained, and made fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>And here take notice, that thoſe who had the chief ſtroke in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, were before-hand reſolved, that none but Engliſh Heads or hands ſhould be uſed therein. <hi>Calvin</hi> offered his aſſiſtance to Archbiſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> as himſelf confeſſeth, but he refuſed the offer. And though it was thought neceſſary, for the better ſeaſoning of both Univerſities in the Proteſtant Reformed Religion, that <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> two eminent Divines of Forreign Churches, ſhould be invited to come over, yet had the Liturgy paſſed the approbation of the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, if not both Houſes of Parliament before their coming. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, they all ſubſcribed it, except Doctor <hi>Day,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then in Parliament it was enacted, that all ſuch poſitive Lawes and Ordinances, as prohibited the marriages of Prieſts, and pains and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures therein contained, ſhould be repealed.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament alſo it was enacted, that no perſon ſhould from thence-forth take, or carry away any Tithe or Tithes which had been received or paid within the ſpace of fourty years next before the date thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the pain or forfeiture of the Treble value of the Tithes ſo taken or carried away. To which a clauſe was alſo added, enabling the ſaid Parſons, Vicars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enter upon any man's Land for the due ſetting out of his Tithes, and carrying away the ſame without moleſtation.</p>
               <p>There alſo paſſed another Act for Abſtinence from fleſh upon all ſuch days, as had been formerly taken and reputed for faſting-dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> fall Fridays and Saturdays in the year, the time of Lent, the Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, the Eves or Vigils of ſuch Saints, as had been anciently uſed for Faſts by the Rules of the Church. On <hi>Septemb.</hi> 5. 1548. Doctor <hi>Farrar's</hi> was conſecrated Biſhop of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and not in the year 1547. as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> makes it, nor in 1549. as Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>The Lord Protector pulled down two Churches, two Chappels, and three Epiſcopal Houſes for the materials of the building of his new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Palace, called <hi>Sommerſet-houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time there aroſe a ſort of men, who were termed Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, againſt whom Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> inveigheth, in the Preface to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the ten Commandments. Some Anabaptiſts alſo diſcovered themſelves. Some of the Chiefs of them were convented before the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Doctor <hi>Cox</hi> Almoner to the King and others: and being convicted of their errours, ſome of them were diſmiſſed only with an Admonition, ſome ſentenced
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53424:92"/> to a Recantation, and others (among which I find one <hi>Champney</hi>'s) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to bear their Faggots at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs.</p>
               <p>Then brake forth two dangerous Rebellions, one in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> the other in <hi>Norfolk.</hi> That of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> was found to be chiefly raiſed in maintenance of their old Religion. On Whitſun Munday, being next day after the firſt exerciſing of the publick Liturgy, ſome few of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners of the Pariſh of <hi>Sampford-Courtney,</hi> compelled their Pariſh-Prieſt, who is ſuppoſed to have invited them to that compulſion, to let them have the Latine Maſs as in former-times. Theſe being ſeconded with many others, <hi>Henry Arundel</hi> Eſquire, Governour of the Mount in <hi>Cornwal, Winſlade</hi> and <hi>Coffin,</hi> Gentlemen, headed them. The ſeditious exceeding the number of ten thouſand, march in a full body to <hi>Exeter.</hi> They ſend their demands to the King, among which one more ſpecially concerned the Liturgy. It was demanded by the Rebels, That foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we conſtantly believe, that after the words of Conſecration ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Prieſt being at Maſs, there is very really the Body and Blood of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. God and man, and that no ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remaineth after, but the very ſelf-ſame body that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was given upon the Croſs for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Therefore we will have Maſs Celebrated as it was in times paſt without any man Communicating with the Prieſts, foraſmuch as many preſuming unworthily to receive the ſame, put no difference between the Lord's body, and other kind of meat, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which demand of theirs the King thus anſwered, <hi>viz.</hi> that for the Maſs I aſſure you, no ſmall ſtudy nor Travel hath been ſpent, by all the Learned Clergy therein: and to avoyd all contention, it is brought even to the uſe that Chriſt left it, as the Apoſtles uſed it, as the Holy Fathers delivered it: indeed ſomewhat altered from that to which the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> for their lucre, had brought it. And although (ſaith he) you may hear the contrary from ſome Popiſh evil men; Yet we on our Honour aſſure you, that they deceive, abuſe you, and blow theſe opinions into your Heads to finiſh their own purpoſes. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſatisfying not, they marched with all their forces to the ſiege of <hi>Exeter,</hi> carrying before them in their march the Pix or Conſecrated Hoſt under a Canopy, with Croſſes, Banners, Candleſticks, Holy-bread, and Holy-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> with forces conjoyned, ſo ſtrongly charged the Rebels, that they beat them out of their works, and then forced them with great ſlaughter to raiſe their ſiege. After the like ſucceſs in ſome following fights, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> enters that City on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. where he was joyfully received by the half-ſtarved Citizens. <hi>Miles Coverdale</hi> gave publick thanks to God for the Victory in the view of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and ſoon after was made the Biſhop thereof.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:53424:92"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arundel, Berry, Winſlade,</hi> and <hi>Coffin</hi> were ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and there executed. Six Popiſh Prieſts were hanged, and the Vicar of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> (one of the Grand Incendiaries) hanged on the top of his own Steeple, appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in his Popiſh Weeds, with his Beads at his Girdle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Norfolk</hi> Rebellion brake forth on <hi>June</hi> 20. and that eſpecially for a grievance about Encloſures. The Rebels had gotten one <hi>Robert Ket,</hi> a rich <hi>Tanner</hi> of <hi>Wimondham</hi> for their Leader, and were grown to a Body of twenty thouſand, ſeating themſelves at <hi>Mouſhold</hi> near Mount <hi>Surrey,</hi> where they carried a face (as it were) of Juſtice and Religion, for they had one <hi>Coniers,</hi> an idle fellow, to be their Chaplain, who read ſolemn Prayers to them Morning and Evening, Sermons alſo they had often. And as for Juſtice, they had a bench under a Tree (which Tree was called by them, and ſo hath ever ſince been called, <hi>the Tree of Reformation</hi>) where <hi>Ket</hi> uſually ſate, and with him two Companies of every Hundred, whence their Companies had been raiſed, to hear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and give judgement. They ſent certain complaints to the King, requiring he would ſend a Herrald to them to give them ſatisfaction. The King returned this anſwer, that in <hi>October</hi> following he would call a Parliament, wherein their complaints ſhould be heard, and their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſhould be redreſſed, requiring them in the mean time to lay down Arms, and return to their houſes, and thereupon granting them a general pardon. But this not ſatisfying the ſeditious, hereupon they firſt aſſaulted the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> took it, and made <hi>Thomas Cod</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> attend them as their ſervant. At length He and others of the Gentry detained Priſoners in <hi>Ket</hi>'s Camp, were admitted to the Counſels of the Rebels for the better credit thereof.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> (afterward Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) getting up into <hi>the Oak of Reformation,</hi> Preached to the Rebels of their Duty and Obedience, where his life was in danger, many Arrows being Shot at him. <hi>Conyers</hi> ſet the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> during the ſinging whereof the Doctor withdrew, and went to his own houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Par</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Sheffield</hi> and <hi>Wentworth,</hi> Sir <hi>Anthony Denny,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler</hi> and other perſons of Honour, is ſent to quell this Rebellion. But ſucceſs ſailed them: the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> was barbarouſly butchered, Sir <hi>Thomas Cornwallis</hi> taken priſoner, and the City fired by the Rebels, but the clouds melting into tears pittying the Cities calamity, quenched the flames, and the Marqueſs quitting the ſervice, returned to <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was <hi>John Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſent to undertake the task, and was attended by the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton.</hi> Coming to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> he eaſily entred the City, and entertained the Rebels with many Sallies with various ſucceſs, but generally the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> came off with the better.</p>
               <p>The Rebels deſerted <hi>Mouſhold-hill,</hi> and came down into <hi>Duſſing-dale.</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:53424:93"/> Here their ſuperſtition fancied themſelves ſufficiently fenced by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an old prophecy.</p>

               </q>
               <p>In this place was a bloody battel: two thouſand of the Rebels were ſlain in the fight and chaſe, the Reſidue of them ſcattered all over the Countrey: the Principals of them taken, and Executed: <hi>Robert Ket</hi> hanged on <hi>Norwich-Caſtle, William</hi> his brother, on the Top of <hi>Wimond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſteeple, nine of his followers on as many boughs of the Oak where <hi>Ket</hi> held his Courts. On <hi>Auguſt</hi> XXIX. a ſolemn thankſgiving was made to God for their deliverance, in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually obſerved. As for the Rebellion at the ſame time in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> it was ſoon quelled on the Execution of <hi>Omler</hi> and <hi>Dale,</hi> the chief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters thereof.</p>
               <p>Theſe things quickned the Lords of the Council to a ſharper courſe againſt all thoſe whom they ſuſpected not to advance the publick Liturgy. Among whom none was more diſtruſted than Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who is commanded to attend the Lords of the Council on <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. by whom he was told, that by his negligence not only many people within his Dioceſs forgat their duty to God in frequenting the Divine Service than by Law eſtabliſhed, but divers others deſpiſing the ſame, did in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places often frequent the Popiſh Maſs. Therefore he is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Preach againſt the Rebels at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs on <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1. and there to ſhew the unlawfulneſs of taking Arms on pretence of Religion. But on the Contrary, he ſpent moſt part of his Sermon in maintenance of the Croſs, Carnal and Papiſtical preſence of Chriſt's body and bloud in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: complaints whereof being made, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is Iſſued out to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and Doctor <hi>May,</hi> before whom he was convented at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where after many ſhifts on his part, and much patience on theirs, he is taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> deprived of his Biſhoprick. To whom ſucceeded Doctor <hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There paſſed an Act of Parliament in the following Seſſion (which took beginning <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4) for taking down of ſuch Images, as were ſtill remaining in the Churches, as alſo for the bringing in of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonaries, Miſſals, Breviaries, Offices, Horaries, Primars and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſionals, with other Books of falſe and ſuperſtitious worſhip. The Tenour of which Act ſignified to the Subject by the King's Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeconded by the Miſſives of Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan Biſhops, requiring them to ſee it diligently put in execution. Alſo the Biſhops were required to puniſh all thoſe that refuſed to give

               <p>But then there ſtarted up another faction, as oppoſite to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy, as were thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Archbiſhop and the reſt of Prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We muſt not forget, that this earneſt conteſt was not about the vocation, but about the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Biſhops.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53424:94"/> for keeping down that oppoſite humour. This controverſie was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> for beſides his judgement which he gives of theſe things in ſome of his Epiſtles about things of this nature, he hath told us of his own practice in one of his Epiſtles, Dated at <hi>Zurick, Novemb.</hi> 4. 1559. being more than five years after he had left this Kingdom. That he had never uſed the Surplice, when he lived in <hi>Oxford,</hi> though he were then a Canon of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent in the Quire. While this controverſie was on foot between the Biſhops and the Clergy, <hi>John Rogers</hi> (one of the Probends of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and Divinity Reader of that Church then newly return'd from beyond the Seas) could never be perſwaded to wear any other than the round cap when he went abroad. And being further preſſed unto it, he thus declared himſelf: That he would never agree to that point of Conformity, but on this condition, that if the Biſhops did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Cap and Tippet, &amp;c. then it ſhould alſo be declared, that all Popiſh Prieſts (for a diſtinction between them and others) ſhould be conſtrained to wear upon their ſleeves a Chalice with an Hoſt upon it. Nay, ſuch peccancy of humour began then to break out, that it was Preached at <hi>Paul</hi>s Croſs by one <hi>Steven,</hi> Curate of <hi>Katherine Cree-Church,</hi>

John Stow</hi> ſaith, that he had ſeen the ſaid <hi>Steven</hi> to leave the Pulpit, and Preach to the People out of an high Elm, which ſtood in the midſt of the Church-yard, and that being done, to return into the Church again.</p>
               <p>The wings of Epiſcopal Authority had been ſo clipped, that it was ſcarce able to fly abroad: the ſentence of Excommunication had not been in uſe ſince the firſt year of this King; which occaſioned not onely theſe diſorders among the Miniſters of the Church but alſo tended to the great encreaſe of vitiouſneſs in all ſorts of men. So that it was not without cauſe that it was called for ſo earneſtly by Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> in a Sermon Preached before the King.

He appointed the form of a right Table to be uſed in his Dioceſs, and cauſed the wall ſtanding on the back-ſide of the Altar in the Church of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s to be broken down for an example to the reſt. No univerſal change of Altars was there into Tables in all parts of the Realm, till the repealing of the firſt Liturgy, in which the Prieſt is appointed to ſtand before the midſt of the Altar in the Celebration; and the eſtabliſhing of the ſecond, (in which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the Prieſt ſhall ſtand on the North-ſide of the Table) had put an end to the Diſpute.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> metre, by <hi>Thomas Sternhold,</hi> Eſq and of the Privy Chamber to King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>John Hopkins, Robert Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. and generally permitted to be Sung in all Churches.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> having been a Priſoner in the Tower almoſt two years, the Lord Treaſurer, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and ſome others are ſent with certain Articles Signed by the King and Lords of the Council unto him. According to the tenour hereof; he is not only to teſtifie his conſent to the eſtabliſhing the Holy-dayes and Faſting-days by the King's Authority, the allowance of the publick Liturgy, and the abrogating of the Statute for the ſix Articles, but to ſubſcribe the confeſſion of his fault in his former obſtinacy, after ſuch form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was there required. To which Articles he ſubſcribed, but refuſed to put his hand to the ſaid Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Then a Book of Articles is drawn up, containing all the alteration made by the King and his Father, as well by Act of Parliament as their own injunctions, of all which doings he is required to ſignifie his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, to make Confeſſion of his fault with an acknowledgment that he had deſerved the puniſhment which was laid upon upon him: but no ſuch ſubmiſſion and acknowledgment being made as was required, on <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. 1550. he was deprived, and ſo remitted to the Tower.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this ſeverity, yet ſome of the Biſhops were ſo ſtiff in their old opinions, that neither terrour nor perſwaſions could prevail upon them, ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Biſhoprick of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> was given in <hi>Commendam</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Hooper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> having been bred up in the Romiſh Religion, would not change her mind. And although the King and the Lords of his Council, wrote many Letters to her, to take off thoſe affections which ſhe bear to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſhe keeps up her Maſs, with all the Rites and Ceremonies belonging to it, and ſuffers divers perſons (beſides her own domeſtick Servants) to be preſent at it. By the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's mediation, her Chaplains were permitted to celebrate the Maſs, but with this Reſtriction, that they ſhould do it in her preſence only. For the tranſgreſſion of which bounds, <hi>Mallet</hi> and <hi>Barkley,</hi> her two Chaplains were impriſoned.</p>
               <p>Then a Plot is laid to convey the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> out of the Realm by ſtealth; but the King being ſecretly advertiſed of the deſign, puts a ſtop thereunto. She is brought to the King, and appointed to remain with him, but none of her Chaplains permitted to have any acceſs unto her.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding the mediation of the Emperor in her behalf, and his threatening War, in caſe ſhe were not permitted the free exerciſe of her Religion, and although the Lords of the Council generally ſeemed very inclinable thereunto, yet the King would not be perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And when the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> ſent by the Lords to the King, uſed divers Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, he declared a Reſolution rather to venture life, and all things elſe that were dear unto him, than to give way to any thing, which he knew to be againſt the Truth. Then the King burſt forth into a flood of tears, and the Biſhops, on ſight thereof, wept as faſt as He.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops thereupon withdrew, admiring at ſuch great Abilities in ſo young a King, and bleſſed God for giving them a Prince of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piety.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:53424:96"/>
               <p>Then the reviewing the Liturgy, and the compoſing of a Book of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, were brought under conſideration: This laſt for the avoiding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Opinions, and for the eſtabliſhing conſent touching true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the other for removing ſuch offences as had been taken by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his followers, at ſome parts thereof. The Liturgy, ſo reviewed, was ratified by Act of Parliament in the year following. By the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writings of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Melancthon,</hi> together with the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion (a Book of Articles being thought neceſſary to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) the Compoſers of thoſe Articles were much directed, uſing them as ſubſervient Helps to promote the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now followed the fatal Tragedy of the Duke of <hi>Sommerſet,</hi> and we muſt recoyl a little to fetch forward the cauſe thereof. <hi>Thomas Seymour,</hi> Baron of <hi>Sudely,</hi> and Lord Admiral, the Protector's younger Brother, had married the Lady <hi>Katherine Par,</hi> the Relict of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. A conteſt aroſe between their Wives about place. The Women's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords derived themſelves into their Husbands hearts: whereupon, not long after, followed the death of the Lord <hi>Thomas Seymour,</hi> arraigned for deſigning to tranſlate the Crown to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Lords of the Council accuſe the Protector of many high offences; his greateſt Enemy and Accuſer was <hi>John Dudley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Hereupon he was impriſoned at <hi>Windſor,</hi> yet he was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though outed his Protectorſhip, reſtored, and continued Privy Counſellor. But after two years and two months his Enemies aſſault him afreſh. He was indicted of Treaſon and Felony: he was condemned for Felony, by a new made Statute, for plotting the death of a Privy Counſellor, namely, the Earl of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Here a ſtrange overſight was committed, that he craved not the benefit of the Clergy, which could not legally be denied him. Not long after he was beheaded on Tower-hill, with no leſs praiſe for his piety and patience, than pity and grief of the beholders.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 1551. happened a terrible Earthquake at <hi>Croydon,</hi> and ſome other Villages thereabouts, in the County of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey.</hi> Afterwards ſix Dolphins were taken up in the <hi>Thames,</hi> three at <hi>Queenborough,</hi> and three near <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the leaſt as big as any Horſe.

               <p>Sir <hi>Michael Stanhop,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Vane,</hi> and Sir <hi>Miles Partridge,</hi> were arraigned, and condemned to dye.

               <p>The next care was, that Conſecrated places ſhould not be profaned by fighting and quarrelling, as they had been lately ſince the Epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and the ancient Cenſures of the Church were leſſened in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and reputation.</p>
               <p>This Parliament ending on <hi>April</hi> 15. the Book of Common-prayer was printed and publiſhed, which had been therein authorized. And the time being come which was ſet for the officiating it, there appeared much alteration in the outward ſolemnities of Divine ſervice, to which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had formerly been ſo long accuſtomed.

To give a beginning hereunto, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> did the ſame day officiate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice of the Morning in his Rochet only, without Cope or Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he preached alſo at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in the afternoon, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Companies in their beſt Liveries in their Companies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at it, the Sermon tending (for the moſt part) to the ſetting forth the ſaid Book of Common-prayer, and to acquaint them with the Reaſons of ſuch alterations as were made therein. On the ſame day the new Liturgy was executed alſo in all the Churches of <hi>London.</hi> Not long after, the upper Quire in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, where the high Altar ſtood was broken down, and all the Quire thereabout, and the Communion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table was placed in the lower part of the Quire, where the Miniſter ſang the daily Service.</p>
               <p>Then publick care was had for the founding and eſtabliſhing of the new Hoſpital in the late diſſolved Houſe of <hi>Gray-Friers</hi> near <hi>Newgate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the Borough of <hi>Southwark:</hi> of which ye are to know, that the Church belonging to the ſaid Houſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Cloyſters, and almoſt all the publick building which ſtood within the liberties and precincts thereof, had the good hap to eſcape that ruine, which generally befell all other Houſes of that nature. And ſtanding undemoliſhed till the laſt times of King <hi>Henry,</hi> it was given by him, not many dayes before his death, to the City of <hi>London,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the late diſſolved Priory, called <hi>Little St. Bartholomews.</hi> In which Donation there was reference had to a double end: The one for the relieving the poor out of the Rents of ſuch Meſſuages and Tenements, as in the Grants thereof are contained and ſpecified. The other for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a Pariſh-church in the Church of the ſaid diſſolved <hi>Grey-friers,</hi> not only for the uſe of ſuch as lived within the precincts of the ſaid two Houſes, but for the Inhabitants of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and of St. <hi>Edwin</hi>'s, ſituate in <hi>Warwick-lane,</hi> near <hi>Newgate-market.</hi> Which Churches, with all the Rents and profits belonging to them, were given to the City at the ſame time alſo, and for advancing the ſame ends, together with five hundred Marks <hi>per annum</hi> for ever: The Church of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53424:97"/> the Gray-friers to be from thence-forth called <hi>Christ-church,</hi> founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight. All which was ſignified to the City, in a Sermon Preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, by the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> on <hi>January</hi> 13. being but a fortnight before his death: Maſs was ſaid in this Church by the Pariſhoners that reſorted to it according to the King's donation.

               <p>But theſe things being not ſufficient to carry on the work to the end deſired, it hapned that Biſhop <hi>Rialey,</hi> Preaching before King <hi>Edward,</hi> inſiſted much upon ſome conſtant courſe for relief of the poor: which Sermon wrought ſo far upon him, that having ſent for the Biſhop, he gave him great thanks for his good Exhortation, whoſe advice was, that Letters ſhould be written to the Lord Mayor and Alderman. By whom it was agreed, that a general contribution ſhould be made by all rich and well-affected Citizens, toward the advancement of a work ſo neceſſary for the publick good. Every man ſubſcribed according to his ability, and Books were drawn in every ward of the City. containing the ſum of that Relief which they had contributed: Which being delivered to Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs,</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> were by him tendred to the King's Commiſſioners, <hi>February</hi> 17. The buildings in the Gray-friers were forthwith repaired: The like reparation was alſo made of the ruinous buildings belonging to the late diſſolved Priory of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> which the Citizens had then newly bought of the King, to ſerve for an Hoſpital for ſuch Sick, Wounded, and Impotent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as were not fit to be intermingled with the ſound: on <hi>November</hi> 23. the Sick and Maimed people were taken into the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi> and into <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> Hoſpital, to the number of four hundred Children; all of them to have Meat, Drink, Lodging and Clothes, at the charge of the City; till other means could be provided for their maintenance.</p>
               <p>On <hi>April</hi> 10. this King gave for ever to the City his Palace of <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> (erected by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth) to be employed for ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds and thriftleſs poor, as ſhould be ſent thither to receive chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be forced to labour. He cauſed the Maſter and Brethren of the Hoſpital in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, to reſign the ſame into his hands, with all the Lands and Goods thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: out of which he preſently beſtowed the yearly rent of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Marks, with all the Beds, Bedding, and other Furniture found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in toward the maintenance of the ſaid Work-houſe, and the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark;</hi> The Grant whereof he confirmed by his Letters Patents, adding thereunto a Mortmain for enabling the City to

               </p>
               <p>Then for raiſing Money, a Commiſſion was ſpeeded into all parts of the Kingdom, under pretence of ſelling ſuch of the Lands and Goods of Chanteries as remained unſould, but in plain truth (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) to ſeize upon all Hangings, Altar-clothes, Fronts, Parafronts, Copes of all ſorrs, with all manner of Plate, which was to be found in any Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral or Parochial Church. Certain Inſtructions were likewiſe given to the Commiſſioners, by which they were to regulate themſelves in their proceedings. This was done generally in all parts of the Realm, into which the Commiſſioners began their Circuits in the moneth of <hi>April;</hi> which general ſeizure being made, they were to leave one Chalice, with certain Table-clothes for the uſe of the Communion-table, as the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhould think fit; the Jewels, Plate, and ready Money, to be delivered to the Maſter of the King's Jewels, in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> the Copes of cloth of Gold, and Tiſſue to be brought into the King's Wardrobe; the reſt to be turned into ready Money, and that Money to be paid to Sir <hi>William Peckham</hi> the King's Cofferer, for the defraying the charges of his Majeſtie's houſhold.</p>
               <p>But ſome there were, who were as much before hand with the Kings Commiſſioners in embezeling the Plate, Jewels, and other Furnitures, as the Commiſſioners did intend to be with the King, in keeping all or moſt part to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The King grew Sick, and weak in Body, in which Eſtate Duke <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> ſo prevailed upon him, that he conſented to a tranſpoſition of the Crown, from his natural Siſters, to the Children of the Dutchefs of <hi>Suffolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His dying Prayer, as is was taken from his mouth, was in theſe words following.</p>
               <q>Lord God, deliver me out of the miſeries of this wretched and ſinful life, and take me among thy choſen. Howbeit, not my will, but thy will be done, Lord, I commit my Spirit to Thee. O Lord, thou knoweſt, how happy it were for me to be with Thee; yet for thy choſens ſake ſend me life and health, that I may truly ſerve Thee. O my Lord God, bleſs thy people, and ſave thine inheritance. O Lord God, ſave thy choſen people of <hi>England,</hi> O my Lord God, defend this Realm from Papiſtry, and maintain thy true Religion, that I

               <p>Thus endeth the Reign of that good King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently remarkable for the progreſs of Reformation, but ſo diſtracted unto Sides and Factions, that in the end the King himſelf became a prey to the ſtrongeſt party, which (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) could not otherwiſe be ſafe but in his deſtruction, contrived on purpoſe (as it was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed) to ſmooth the way to the advancement of the Lady <hi>Jane Gray</hi> (newly married to <hi>Guilford Dudley,</hi> fourth Son to Duke <hi>Dudley</hi>) to the Royal Throne.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> hearing of her Brothers death, and knowing her own right, writeth to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and challengeth them for their doing, making her claim to the Crown. To whom the Council writeth again, as to a Subject, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to reſt ſo contented: The Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was on the ſame day that theſe Letters were diſpatched, brought by Water to the Tower, attended by a Noble Train of both Sexes, from <hi>Durham-houſe</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where ſhe had been entertained, as part of <hi>Dudley</hi>'s Family, ever ſince her Marriage: When ſhe came into the preſence of the two Dukes, her Father and Father in Law, it was ſignified to Her by the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> that the King was dead, and that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her for his next Succeſſor in the Crown. After a pithy ſpeech, the poor Lady found her ſelf in a great perplexity. But being wearied at laſt with their importunities, and overcome by the entreaties of her Husband whom ſhe dearly loved, ſhe ſubmitted unto that neceſſity which ſhe could not vanquiſh.</p>

And on the ſame day about five a Clock in the afternoon, they ſolemnly cauſed her to be Proclaimed Queen of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. in many of the principal Streets of <hi>London;</hi> and after by degrees, in moſt of the chief Cities, Towns, and places of greateſt concourſe. In which Proclamation it was ſignified, <hi>That by the Letters Patents of the late King</hi> Edward, <hi>the Lady</hi> Jane Gray, <hi>eldeſt Daughter to the Dutcheſs of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>had been declared, to be his true and lawful Succeſſor to the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>the ſame to be enjoyed after her deceaſe by the heirs of her Body,</hi> &amp;c.

The Preacher with difficulty was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a School adjoyning: By reaſon of which tumult the Lords of the Council with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, took order, that every Houſholder ſhould cauſe their Children and Apprentices to keep their own Pariſh-churches upon Holidays: order was taken for preventing the like Tumult on the Sunday following. A Sermon was Preached at the Croſs by Doctor <hi>Watſon,</hi> who (afterwards was Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>) for whoſe ſecurity many Lords of the Council were there preſent, and <hi>Jerningham,</hi> Captain of the Guard with two hundred of his Yeomen, ſtanding round about the Pulpit with their Halberts.</p>
               <p>Then care was taken, that nothing ſhould be Preached in private Churches, contrary to the Doctrine which was, and ſhould be Taught at the Croſs, by them which were appointed to it. It was further ordered, that every Alderman in his Ward ſhould ſend for the Curates of every Church within their Liberties, and warn them not onely to forbear Preaching themſelves, but alſo not to ſuffer any other to Preach, or make any open reading of Scripture in their Churches, unleſs the ſaid Preachers were ſeverally, Licenſed by the Queen.</p>

Seeing by the fidelity of the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Proteſtant Gentry, the Queen was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged for the ſpeedy recovering of her <hi>Right,</hi> they conceived, that as ſhe by them had regained the Crown, ſo they under her ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Conſciences.

               <p>The Queen on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18. puts forth a Proclamation, declaring her ſelf for the Popiſh Religion, which ſhe reſolves to obſerve for her ſelf, wiſhing her Subjects to follow her example; yet that ſhe mindeth not to compel any thereunto, until ſuch time as further order by common Aſſent may be taken therein: forbidding all her Subjects to move Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>Hereupon many of the people in divers places, received their old Religion, erected again their Altars, and uſed the Maſs, and Latin Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as was wont to be in King <hi>Henrie</hi>'s time.</p>

               <p>The News of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> ſucceeding her Brother to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> poſted to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was very welcome to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, becauſe it gave him ſome aſſurance of his re-admiſſion into the Power and Juriſdiction of his Predeceſſors in the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> in purſuance of which hopes, it was reſolved, that Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> ſhould be ſent Legate into <hi>England,</hi> who being of the Blood-royl, and a man of eminent Learning and of exemplary life, was looked on as the fitteſt Inſtrument to reduce that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Parliaments firſt Act was to take away all Statutes paſſed by the two laſt Kings, wherein certain Offences had been made High Treaſon, and others brought within the compaſs of a <hi>Pramunire.</hi> This was done eſpecially for <hi>Pool</hi>'s ſecurity; that neither He by exerciſing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor the Clergy by ſubmitting to it, might be entangled in the like ſnares, as Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> and the whole Clergy of his time had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been caught.</p>
               <p>Then an Act was paſſed for repealing certain Statutes of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi> thereby they took away all former Statutes for adminiſtring the Sacraments in both kinds, for eſtabliſhing the firſt and ſecond Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word! by this one blow the Queen cut down all that had been done in the Reformation in ſeven years before. And then for want of Canonical Ordination on the one ſide, and under colour of Uncanonical Marriages on the other, there was preſently ſuch a remove among the Biſhops and Clergy, as it is not any where to be paralelled in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
               <p>An Act was paſſed likewiſe, Entitled, <hi>An Act against offenders of Preachers,</hi> &amp;c which two Acts were ſeconded by the Queen, with two Proclamations, <hi>December</hi> 5. By one of which it was declared, that all Statutes made in the time of the late King <hi>Edward,</hi> which concerned Religion, were repealed by Parliament: and therefore that the Maſs ſhould be ſaid as formerly, to begin on the twentieth of that moneth. And by the other it was commanded, that no perſon ſhould dare from thenceforth to diſturb any Prieſts in ſaying Maſs, or executing any other Divine Office. Accordingly the Maſs was publickly officiated in all parts of the Kingdom, and ſo continued during the Reign of the Queen without interruption.</p>
               <p>Another Act was paſſed, wherein it was Enacted. <hi>That the Marriage between King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth, and Queen</hi> Katherine, <hi>his first Wife, was lawful, and to ſtand with God's Laws and his Holy Word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Decree of Divorce heretofore paſſed between the ſaid King</hi> Henry, <hi>and the ſaid Queen, by</hi> Thomas Cranmer, <hi>Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury,

                  <hi>ſhould be reputed to be void and null, with a Repeal of all ſuch Statutes, wherein the Queen had been diclared to be Illegitima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>There alſo paſt another Act, in which there was a clauſe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validating of all ſuch Commiſſions as had been granted in the time of the late Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> and one in confirming the Attainders of the late Duke of <hi>Northumberland, Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Together with this Parliament the Queen ſummoned a Convocation, that all matters of Religion might firſt be debated and concluded in a Synodical way, before they were offered to the Parliament. In the Writs of which Summons, ſhe retained the Title of <hi>Supreme Head on</hi>

The Preſidentſhip of the Convocetion was transferred upon Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> priviledged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his See to preſide in all ſuch Provincial Synods, which were either held during the vacancy of the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abſence of the Metropolitan.</p>
               <p>The lower Houſe of the Clergy alſo was fitted with a Prolocutor of the ſame affections, Doctor <hi>Hugh Weſton,</hi> Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the place of Doctor <hi>Cox.</hi> So partially had the elections been returned from the ſeveral Dioceſſes, that we find none of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy among the Clerks; and but ſix of the Deans and Dignitaries to have ſuffrage in the Convocation, <hi>viz. James Haddon,</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter; Walter Philips,</hi> Dean of <hi>Rocheſter; John Philpot,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter; John Elmer,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Stow,</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Lincoln; Richard Cheiney,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Hereford;</hi> one more mentioned by Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> without a name, joyned himſelf to the other five in the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>The Prolocutor would admit of no more, though deſired by <hi>Philpot,</hi> that ſome of the Divines which had the paſſing of the Book of Articles, in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, might be aſſembled with them in the defence thereof.</p>
               <p>The main point in debate, concernded the manner of Chriſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Sacrament: It was not denied by <hi>Philpot,</hi> and his Brethren, That Chriſt was preſent in the Sacrament rightly adminiſtred, according to his Inſtitution, but onely that He was not preſent in the groſs and carnal manner, which They of the Popiſh party had before ſubſcribed unto. Six dys the diſputation laſted, but to little effect At length <hi>Weſton</hi> put an end to the diſpute, ſaying, <hi>It is not the Queen's pleaſure, that we ſhould ſpend any longer time in theſe debates, and yet are well enough already: For you</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>have the Word, and we have the Sword.</hi>

               <p>The Parliament began <hi>Novemb.</hi> 12. where a way was opened for Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi>'s Reception by preparing a Bill, whereby he was to be diſcharged of the Attainder which had paſſed upon him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1539. reſtored in Blood, and rendred Capable of all thoſe Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of which he had ſtood poſſeſſed in this Kingdom. This Bill was quickly paſſed into an Act, and on <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. the Cardinal came firſt to <hi>London.</hi> Then it was concluded, by both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that a petition ſhould be made in the name of the Kingdom, wherein ſhould be declared, how ſorry they were, that they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn their obedience from the Apoſtolick See, and conſenting to the Statutes made againſt it, promiſing to endeavour hereafter, that the ſaid Lawes and Statutes ſhould be repealed, beſeeching the King and Queen to intercede with his Holineſs for their Abſolution. Then the Cardinal having read his Authority given him from the Pope, they all kneeled upon their knees, and imploring the mercy of God, received
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53424:105"/> Abſolution for themſelves and the reſt of the Kingdom; Which Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was pronounced in theſe words</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which with his moſt pretious blood hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from all our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and whom the Father hath appointed Head over all his Church, abſolve you.

And alſo we do reſtore you again unto the unity of Our Mother the Holy Church. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Which words of His being ſeconded with a loud <hi>Amen,</hi> by ſuch as were preſent, he concluded the dayes work with a ſolemn Proceſſion to the Chappel, for rendring thanks to God. Then did the Cardinal diſpence with much irregularity in ſeveral perſons, confirming the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Clergy-men in their Benefices, legitimating the Children of forbidden Marriages, ratifying the proceſſes and ſentences in matters Eccleſiaſtical: and his diſpenſations were confirmed by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then was <hi>Anthony Brown,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Montacute, Thursby</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Carn,</hi> ſent on a gratulatory Embaſſie to Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. to tender <hi>England</hi>'s thanks for the favours conferr'd thereon.</p>
               <p>The Convocation that then was held, knew that the Cardinal was to be entreated, not to inſiſt upon the reſtoring of Church-lands, rather to confirm the Lords and Gentry in their preſent poſſeſſions. And to that end a Petition is preſented to both their Majeſties, that they would be <note place="margin">

                  </note> pleaſed to intercede with the Cardinal concerning it: Which Petition was offered to the Legate in the name of the whole Convocation by the Lord Chancellor, the Prolocutor, and ſix others of the Lower Houſe. Concerning which the Legate was not ignorant, that a Meſſage had been ſent to the Pope in the name of the Parliament, to deſire a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Sale of all the Lands belonging to Abbies, Chanteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or otherwiſe to let him know, that nothing could be granted on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. And it is likely, they received ſome fair promiſes to that effect, in regard that on New-years day next following, the Act for reſtoring the Pope's Supremacy was paſſed in both Houſes of Parliament. The whole matter being tranſacted to the content of all parties (the poor Proteſtants excepted only) on <hi>January</hi> 25. there was a ſolemn proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion throughout <hi>London,</hi> to praiſe God for their Converſion to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church: wherein were ninety Croſſes, an hundred and Sixty Prieſts and Clerks, each of them attired in his Cope, and after them
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53424:105"/> eight Biſhops in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> followed by <hi>Bonner</hi> carrying the Popiſh Pix under a Canopy, and attended by the Lord Mayor and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in their ſeveral Liveries. Which Proceſſion being ended, they all returned to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, where the King and Cardinal, together with all the reſt, heard Maſs, and the next day the Parliament and Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation were diſſolved.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Ambaſſadours came to <hi>Rome</hi> on the firſt day of the Papacy of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV. and in the firſt conſiſtory after his Inauguration they were brought before him, who granted the pardon deſired, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly embraced the Ambaſſadours, and as an over plus, the Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Title of King's of <hi>Ireland</hi> on their Majeſties. In his private diſcourſes with the Ambaſſadours, he ſaid that the Church-goods ought to be wholly reſtored, ſaying alſo that his Authority was not ſuch, as to profane things dedicated unto God. He alſo told them, that the <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> ought to be paid as ſoon as might be, and that according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, he would ſend a collector for that purpoſe. He cloſed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe with this, that they could not hope, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> would open to them the Gates of Heaven, as long as they uſurped his goods on earth.</p>
               <p>A rumour was ſpread of the Queen's being with Child, and that ſhe was quick, and thereupon Letters were ſent from the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to <hi>Bonner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> that prayers and thankſgivings ſhould be made in all Churches. The Parliament alſo while it was ſitting, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Act, deſiring the King that if the Queen ſhould fail, he would be pleaſed to take upon him the Education of the Child. Set forms of prayer were alſo made for her ſafe delivery. Great preparations were alſo made of all things neceſſary againſt the time of her delivery. And upon a ſudden rumour of her being delivered, the Bells were rung, and Bonfires made in moſt parts of <hi>London.</hi> But it proved in fine that the Queen neither was with Childe for the preſent, nor had any hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo for the time to come.</p>
               <p>A Gun was ſhot at one Doctor <hi>Pendleton,</hi> as He Preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, <hi>June</hi> 10. 1554, the pellet whereof went very neer him, but the Gunner was not to be heard of. Upon which the Queen publiſhed a Proclamation prohibiting the ſhooting with hand-guns, and the bearing of weapons. A little before this, ſome had cauſed a Cat to be hanged upon the Gallows, near the Croſs in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> with her head ſhorn, the likeneſs of a veſtment caſt upon her, and her two feet tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, holding between them a piece of Paper, in form of a Wafer, tending to the diſgrace of the Popiſh Religion. Then were ſome Antient Statutes revived that were made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, for the ſevere puniſhment of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Hereticks, even to death it ſelf, and an Act was paſſed for that purpoſe.</p>

               <q>My dear brother, foraſmuch as I underſtand by your Books, that we throughly agree, and wholly conſent together in the ſubſtantial points of our Religion, againſt which the world now ſo furiouſly rageth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in times paſt in certain circumſtances of Religion your wiſdom and my ſimplicity (I muſt confeſs) have a little jarred, each of us following the abundance of his own ſpirit. Now (I ſay) be aſſured, that even with my whole heart (God is my witneſs) in the bowels of Chriſt, I love you in the Truth, and for the Truth's ſake which abideth in us, as I am perſwaded, and by the Grace of God ſhall abide in us for evermore. And becauſe the world, as I perceive, Brother, ceaſeth not to play his pageant, and buiſily conſpireth againſt Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, with all poſſible force and power, exalting high things againſt the knowledge of God: let us joyn hands together in Chriſt, though we cannot overthrow, yet to our power, and as much as in us lieth, let us ſhake thoſe high Altitudes, not with carnal, but with ſpiritual wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: and withal (brother) let us prepare our ſelves to the day of diſſolution, by that which after the ſhort time of this bodily affliction by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall triumph together with him in eternal glory.</q>

               <p>The Engliſh conſtituted their new Church, chuſing a Miniſter and Deacons for a time, and, out of conformity to the French, abrogated many things, formerly uſed by them in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Thoſe of <hi>Zurich,</hi> by many dilatory Letters, excuſed themſelves from coming thither. But the main reaſon was, thoſe of <hi>Zurich</hi> were reſolved to recede no whit from the Liturgy uſed in <hi>England</hi> under King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; and unleſs, coming thither they might be aſſured, they ſhould have the full and free uſe thereof, they utterly refuſed any Communion with their Congregation.</p>
               <p>Then came Mr. <hi>John Knox</hi> from <hi>Geneva,</hi> and was choſen by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at <hi>Frankford</hi> for their Paſtor.

But <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Whittingham</hi> were as much bent againſt the ſubſtance of the Book, as againſt any of the Circumſtantials which belonged to it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Grindal</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> return back again to <hi>Strasburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knox,</hi> and others in <hi>Frankford,</hi> drew up, in Latin, a platform of the Engliſh Liturgy, and ſent it to <hi>Geneva,</hi> tendring it to the judgment of Mr. <hi>John Calvin:</hi> who anſwereth, that in the Engliſh Liturgy he had obſerved <hi>multas tolerabiles ineptias,</hi> many tolerable fooleries, adding, that there wanted that purity which was to be deſired in it, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many Relicks of Popiſh dregs; that ſeeing there was no manifeſt impiety in it, it had been tolerated for a ſeaſon, becauſe at firſt it could not otherwiſe be admitted. But howſoever! though it was lawful to begin with ſuch beggarly rudiments, yet it behoved the learned, grave, and godly Miniſters of Chriſt, to endeavour further, and ſet forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more refined from filth and ruſtineſs.</p>
               <p>This being ſent unto <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Whittingham,</hi> thoſe who formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, did afterwards diſlike the Engliſh Liturgy. But in the end it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53424:108"/> was agreed on, that a mixt form, conſiſting partly of the order of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and partly of the Book of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be digeſted, and received till the firſt of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this condition of affairs, Doctor <hi>Richard Cox,</hi> the late Dean of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> firſt School-maſter, and afterward Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, putteth himſelf into <hi>Frankford, March</hi> 13. accompanied with many Engliſh Exiles. Being a man of great learning, of great authority in the Church, and one that had a principal hand in drawing up the Liturgy by Law eſtabliſhed, he could not patiently bear theſe innovations in it. He thereupon firſt begins to anſwer the Miniſter, contrary to the order there agreed on, and the next Lord's-day after cauſeth one of his company to go into the Pulpit, and read the Litany. Againſt which doings of his <hi>Knox,</hi> in a Sermon the ſame day, inveigheth moſt bitterly, affirming many things in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh book to be imperfect, and ſuperſtitious: for which he is both rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by <hi>Cox,</hi> and forbidden to preach. Hereupon <hi>Whittingham</hi> procureth an Order from the Magiſtrates, requiring that the Engliſh ſhould conform themſelves to the Rules of the French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cox</hi> his party being depreſſed, they accuſe <hi>Knox</hi> to the State, for high Treaſon againſt the Emperor, in an Engliſh book of his, entitled, <hi>An Adnonition to all Chriſtians,</hi> firſt privately preached in <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and now publickly printed to the world, wherein he called the Emperor <hi>no leſs an enemy to Chriſt, than</hi> Nero. Hereupon the State of <hi>Frankford</hi> willed <hi>Knox</hi> to depart the City, who on <hi>March</hi> 25. to the great grief of his Friends, left the Congregation, and ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Then Doctor <hi>Cox</hi> and his Adherents proceed to elect Officers in the Congregation. Mr. <hi>Whitehead</hi> is choſen their Paſtor, yet ſo, as two Miniſters, four Elders, and four Deacons were joyned to aſſiſt him. And becauſe this was then an Univerſity, as well as a Congregation, of the Engliſh, Mr. <hi>Robert Horn</hi> was choſen to be Hebrew Reader, Mr. <hi>Mullings</hi> to read the Greek Lecture, and Mr. <hi>Trahern</hi> the Lecture in Divinity.</p>
               <p>Here a moderate motion was made, that the difference might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premiſed, and referred to Arbitrators, which ſhould be equally choſen on both ſides.</p>
               <p>To this Doctor <hi>Cox</hi> his party would in no wiſe conſent, and loſt much reputation by the refuſal.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By Doctor <hi>Cox</hi> his departure a new gap is open for another diſſention. Some words had paſſed, at a Supper, between <hi>Horn</hi> the Paſtor, and <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> a Gentleman of note, intended rather for increaſe of charity, than breach of friendſhip. <hi>Aſhley</hi> is three dayes after cited to appear at the houſe of one of the Elders, to anſwer for ſome words he had ſpoken in contempt of the Miniſtry. But, from the Elders, he appeals to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, among whom he prevails ſo far, that they ſend a Meſſage, by two of their company, to the Paſtor, and Elders, to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cauſe. <hi>Horn</hi> being backed by <hi>Chambers,</hi> the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, excepts againſt this Meſſage, as not decreed by the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and reſolves to maintain that authority, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him and the reſt of the Elders, <hi>Aſhley,</hi> and his party, on the other ſide, proteſt againſt the Paſtor and Elders, as an adverſe party, and therefore not in a capacity to ſit as Judges in the preſent caſe, and do conſult about the making of a Book of Diſcipline for the curbing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant power (for ſo they thought it) of the Paſtors and Elders. Thereupon the Paſtor and Elders forſake their Offices, and on the next day of publick meeting take place among the reſt as private perſons. The Congregation full, but the Pulpit empty, which put the reſt upon a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of electing others to take the Pulpit charge upon them. The noiſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53424:109"/> of theſe diſorders awakens the Magiſtrates, who command <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> to forbear the Congregation until further order, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reſtoring them to their former authority, by publick edict, were contradicted in it by <hi>Aſhley</hi>'s party, who, having got ſome power into their hands, were reſolved to hold it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a Book of Diſcipline had been drawn, and tendred to the Congregation, according to the Rules, whereof the Supreme power, in all Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, was put into the hands of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and the diſpoſing the publick moneys committed to the truſt of <note place="margin">

                  </note> certain Officers, by the name of Deacons. This makes the breach wider than before. The Magiſtrates write their Letters to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> deſiring Doctor <hi>Cox,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sandys,</hi> together with <hi>Robert Berty</hi> Eſquire, to undertake the cloſing of the preſent Rupture. To their arbitrament each party is content to ſubmit the controverſie. In the end a form of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is drawn up by ſome of the Engliſh, who really ſought the peace of the Church. But thoſe, who ſtood for the new diſcipline, refuſed to ſubmit themſelves to any eſtabliſhment, by which the power of the diffuſive body of the Congregation might be called in queſtion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> depart to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> from whence <hi>Chambers</hi> writ his Letters to them twice, but to no effect. They had before elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome new Miniſters, and though <hi>Horn,</hi> and his party, oppoſed it, yet they concluded it for the preſent, and now they mean to ſtand to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, let <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Chambers</hi> go or tarry, as beſt pleaſed themſelves. Such were the troubles and diſorders in the Church of <hi>Frankford,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned firſt by a diſlike of the publick Liturgy, before which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the nakedneſs and ſimplicity of the French and Genevian Churches, (ſaith Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi>) and afterwards continued by the oppoſition made by the general body of the Congregation, againſt ſuch who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be Paſtors and Rulers over them.</p>
               <p>And now it is time to return to <hi>England,</hi> and look back upon <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who had been cited to the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> for nothing could be done againſt the perſon of a Metropolitan, before the Pope had taken cogniſance of the cauſe, and eighty dayes had ſeemingly been given to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> for making his appearance in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And though the Pope knew well enough, as well the Archbiſhop's readineſs to appear before him, if he were at at liberty, as the impoſſibility of making any ſuch appearance, as the caſe then ſtood; yet at the end of the ſaid eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes he is pronounced by the Pope, to be contumacious, and for his contumacy to be degraded, excommunicated, and finally delivered over to the ſecular Magiſtrate. According unto which Decree a Commiſſion is directed unto <hi>Edmond Bonner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Thurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> to proceed in the Degradation of the ſaid Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, who cauſed him to be degraded. After this, and before his death, great pains was taken by a Spaniſh Frier, in the Univerſity, to perſwade
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53424:110"/> him to a retraction of his former Opinions, by whom it was ſuggeſted to him, How acceptable it would be to the King and Queen, how gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to himſelf, in regard both of his ſoul and of his temporal being, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in good hope, that he ſhould not only have his life, but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again to his ancient Dignity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he would but ſubſcribe his name to a piece of Paper, which was made ready for his hand.</p>
               <p>By theſe and the like alluring temptations he was prevailed upon to ſign the Writing, in which were briefly comprehended the chief points of Doctrine defended in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by him formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, both in publick and in private. But all this could not ſave him from being made a Sacrifice to revenge and avarice.</p>
               <p>The Queen had ſtill a vindicative ſpirit againſt him, for the injury which ſhe conceived had been done to her Mother: and the Cardinal (who hitherto had enjoyed the profits of the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> as an Uſufructuary) was altogether as ſolicitous for getting a right and title to them as ſole proprietary. No way to pacifie one, and to ſatisfie the deſires of the other, but by bringing him (when he leaſt looked for it) to the fatal Stake. And thither they brought him, and firſt he retracts his retraction, and after puniſheth that hand which had ſubſcribed it, by holding it forth into the flame, and ſuffering it to be conſumed before the reſt of his body had felt the fire. The reſidue of his body being burnt to aſhes, his heart was found entire and untouched in the midſt of the cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: which poſſibly may ſerve as a witneſs for him, that his heart ſtood faſt unto the Truth, though with his hand he had ſubſcribed ſome Popiſh errors.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> received Conſecration to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Sunday after <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s death.</p>
               <p>No fewer than two hundred are reported to have been burnt by bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> the moſt eminent of all which number was Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who, though of <hi>Gardiner</hi>'s Dioceſs, was condemned by <hi>Bonner, Gardiner</hi> being well enough contented to find out the Game, and leave it to be followed by that bloody Hunter. Dr. <hi>John Chriſtopherſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> is recorded to have burnt ten in one fire at <hi>Lewis,</hi> and ſeventeen others at ſeveral times in ſundry places, among which was <hi>Richard Woodman,</hi> of <hi>Warbleton</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Martyr; and four at <hi>Mayfield,</hi> viz. <hi>John Hart, Thomas Ravenſdal,</hi> a Shoomaker, and a Collier. <hi>Harpfield,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Thornton,</hi> the Suffragan of <hi>Dover,</hi> are ſaid to have poured out blood like water. The ſame is ſaid of <hi>Griffin</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Downing,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Norwich.</hi> The ſame character is given of Biſhop <hi>Bayn</hi> of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi> who burned many faithful Miniſters and others.</p>
               <p>In all the Province of <hi>York</hi> I find none brought to the Stake but <hi>George Marſh</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> condemned thereto by Biſhop <hi>Coles.</hi> Beſides
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53424:110"/> the burning of Biſhop <hi>Farrar,</hi> at <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> by Biſhop <hi>Morgan,</hi> and of <hi>Rawlins,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> at <hi>Cardiff,</hi> by Biſhop <hi>Kitching:</hi> No great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty ſeems to have been acted in the four Welſh Dioceſſes. In the Dioceſs of <hi>Exeter, Wells, Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Lincoln</hi> (though this laſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Kingdom) I find mention but of one a piece: of two in that of <hi>Ely,</hi> and of no more than three apiece in that of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Sarisbury;</hi> for at <hi>Newbury</hi> were burnt that famous <hi>Julius Palmer,</hi> with two others. Doctor <hi>Tunſtal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> was in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time no great perſecutor, his Biſhoprick had dayes of quiet under him. When Mr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> a Preacher was brought before him, and Doctor <hi>Himner,</hi> his Chancellor, would have had him examined more ſtrictly, the Biſhop ſtayed him, ſaying; <hi>Hitherto we have had a good report among our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I pray you bring not this mans blood upon my Head.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle</hi> alſo was a man of a moderate temper.</p>
               <p>The Pope had publiſhed a Bull in print, <hi>Anno</hi> 1556. in which he threatened excommunication to all perſons that kept any Church-lands unto themſelves, as alſo all Princes and Magiſtrates, that did not put the ſame in execution. Which though it did not edifie much in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> yet it found more obedience in that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which a Parliament being called, in <hi>June</hi> 1557. there paſſed an Act for repealing of Statutes, Articles, and Proviſions made againſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the twentieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and for aboliſhing of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eccleſiaſtical poſſeſſions, conveyed to the Laity, as alſo for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment of Firſt-fruits and Twentieth parts (no more than the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payment of the Twentieth part, having been laid by Act of Parliament upon the Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi>) in the firſt and laſt clauſe whereof, as they followed the example of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> ſo poſſibly they might have given a dangerous example to it in the other point, if by the Queens death, which followed ſhortly after, King <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Popes, had not loſt all their power and influence on the Engliſh Nation; by means whereof there was no farther progreſs in the Reſtitution of the Abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, no more re-edifying the old Religious houſes, and no intention for the founding any new.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> having viſited his own Dioceſs, and given out divers printed Articles, to ſhew his great care for the ſuppreſſing the growth of Hereſie, ſent his Commiſſioners to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who interdicted the two Churches, wherein <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the Writ being taken out <hi>de comburendo Haer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> now engageth in her Husband's quarrel, and King <hi>Philip</hi> having made up an Army of thirty five thouſand Foot, and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, beſides a thouſand Horſemen, four thouſand Footment, and two thouſand Pioners ſent out of <hi>England,</hi> under the command of the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> ſate down before St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Piccardy.</hi> On <hi>Auguſt</hi> the tenth the Battels joyn, in which the French were vanquiſhed, and their Army routed, the Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> and <hi>Longueville,</hi> with ſix others of the prime Nobility, and many others of leſs note, being taken priſoners. The Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> the Viſcount <hi>Turin,</hi> moſt of the Foot-Captains, and the common Souldiers, to the number of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred, were ſlain upon the place. King <hi>Philip</hi> ſtormed St. <hi>Quintin</hi> on the eighteenth day. After which ſervice, the Engliſh finding ſome neglect from King <hi>Philip,</hi> deſired to be diſmiſſed into their Country, which was indulged unto them. By whoſe diſmiſſion King <hi>Philip</hi> could do no action of importance in the reſt of the War.</p>
               <p>But the Queen ſhall pay dearly for this Victory. The Engliſh were then poſſeſſed of the Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> with many other Forts therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as <hi>Guiſneſs, Hames, Ardres,</hi> &amp;c. together with the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, a Town ſituate on the mouth of the Engliſh Chanel, oppoſite to <hi>Dover,</hi> and diſtant not above twenty five miles from it. King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, after a Siege of more than eleven months, became Maſter of it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1347. by whom it was firſt made a Colony of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after one of the Staple-Towns for the ſale of Wooll: kept with great care by his Succeſſors, who, as long as they had it in their hand, were ſaid to carry the Keys of <hi>France</hi> at their Girdle: a Town which, for more than two hundred years had been in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh. The Queen had broke the peace with <hi>France,</hi> and taken no care to fortifie this place in this time of War. Then the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> one of the beſt Souldiers of that Age, now called back out of <hi>Italy,</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Governor of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> that the Town was neither ſo well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, nor ſo ſtrongly garriloned, but that it might eaſily be taken, on <hi>New-years-day</hi> ſate down before it, and on <hi>Twelfth-day</hi> had it ſurrendred up unto him, by the Lord Deputy <hi>Wentworth,</hi> who had the chief go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it. <hi>Guiſneſſe, Hames,</hi> and all the other Forts in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Oye</hi> were reduced under the power of the French within few dayes after.</p>
               <p>The Pope is diſpleaſed with Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> by whoſe perſwaſion, it was thought, that the Queen had broke her League with <hi>France,</hi> to take part with her Husband: therefore he deprives <hi>Pool</hi> of the Legantine power, confers the ſame upon Friar <hi>Peitow,</hi> an Engliſh-man by birth, and of good deſcent, whom he deſigns alſo to the See of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> then void by the death of <hi>Capon. Karn,</hi> the Queens Agent with the Pope, advertiſeth her of theſe ſecret practices. <hi>Pool</hi> layes by the Croſs of his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53424:111"/> Legation, and abſtains from the exerciſe of his Bulls and Faculties. <hi>Peitow,</hi> the new Cardinal-Legat, puts himſelf on the way to <hi>England,</hi> when the Queen commandeth him, at his peril, not to adventure to ſet foot on Engliſh ground. <hi>Peitow</hi> died in <hi>April</hi> following, the rupture was made up again, and <hi>Pool</hi> was confirmed in the poſſeſſion of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer powers. And thereupon followed the burning divers perſons in the Dioceſs of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whereof two ſuffered at <hi>Aſhford,</hi> and ſix in his own Metropolitan City. Theſe Godly Martyrs, in their prayers which they made before their Martyrdom, deſired God, that their blood might be the laſt that ſhould be ſhed, and ſo it came to paſs.</p>
               <p>The number of prohibited Books increaſing every day more and more, a Proclamation was ſet forth on <hi>June</hi> the ſixth, to hinder the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſpreading of ſo great a miſchief. Which Proclamation, though it were very ſmart, yet not ſo full of rigour as another, which came out at the burning of ſeven perſons in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> publiſhed both at <hi>Newgate,</hi> where they were impriſoned, and at the Stake where they were to ſuffer, whereby it was ſtraitly charged and commanded, <hi>That no man ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray for, or ſpeak to them, or once ſay, God help them.</hi> Which Proclamation notwithſtanding, <hi>Bentham,</hi> the Miniſter of one of the <hi>London</hi> Congregations, ſeeing the fire ſet to them, turning his eyes unto the people, and cried, <hi>We know they are the People of God, and therefore we cannot chuſe but wiſh well to them, and ſay, God ſtrengthen them.</hi> And ſo he ſaid, <hi>Almighty God, for Chriſt's ſake ſtrengthen them.</hi> With that all the people, with one conſent, cried, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was very admirable, that the Proteſtants ſhould have a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation under <hi>Bonner</hi>'s noſe, yet ſo it was: and in one of thoſe Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, whereof <hi>Bentham</hi> was Miniſter, there aſſembled feldom under forty, many times an hundred and more: the Miniſters whereof ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively were Mr. <hi>Edward Scambler,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Foule,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Rough</hi> convented and condemned by <hi>Bonner,</hi> and burnt for the Truth. After whom followed Mr. <hi>Auguſtine Bernher,</hi> a moderate and learned man, and finally Mr. <hi>Thomas Bentham</hi> forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, who continued in that charge till the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> preferred to the Sea of <hi>Lichfield, Anno</hi> 1589.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding all the care of the Queens Inquiſitors, many good Books of true Chriſtian Conſolation, and good Doctrine, did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find ſome Preſs in <hi>London,</hi> or were ſent over to their Brethren by ſuch learned men as had retired themſelves to their ſeveral Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>Then raged a contagious Fever in moſt parts of the Land, and no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Plague was thought to have deſtroyed a greater number, ſo that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places were left void of Juſtices, and men of worth, to govern the Kingdom. At which time died alſo ſo many Prieſts, that a great number
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53424:112"/> of Pariſh-Churches, in divers places, were unſerved, and no Curates could be gotten for money. Much corn was alſo loſt in the field for want of Workmen to get it in. Phyſitians died as well as the Patients, two of the Queens Doctors dying of it a little before the death of the Queen. It ſpared the Prelat no more than the Prieſt, inſomuch, that within leſs than the ſpace of twelve months almoſt one half of the Engliſh Biſhops had made void their Sees.</p>
               <p>Now God put an end to thoſe calamities of his Children by the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who died of a Dropſie, <hi>November</hi> the ſeventeenth, 1558. Within few hours after her death, died Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He procured of the Queen the Patronage of nineteen Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices unto his See, promiſed, and intended, to repair the Palace at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He was buried in his own Cathedral, with this ſhort and modeſt Epitaph upon his plain Monument, <hi>DEPOSIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M CARDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALIS POLI.</hi>

               <p>The news whereof, being brought unto her by ſome of the Lords, ſhe removes from <hi>Hatfield</hi> on the nineteenth of that month, and with a great and royal Train ſets forward to <hi>London.</hi> At <hi>Highgate</hi> (four miles from the City) ſhe was met by all the Biſhops then living, who preſented themſelves before her upon their knees. In which addreſs, as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed no ſmall contentment, ſo ſhe gave to each of them particularly her hand to kiſs, except only unto <hi>Bonner</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> At her firſt coming to the City, ſhe took her lodging in the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> where ſhe ſtaid ſome dayes, till all things in the Tower might be fitted for her reception. Attended by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, with a ſtately Train of Lords and Ladies, ſhe entreth by <hi>Cripple-gate</hi> into the City, paſſeth along the Wall till ſhe came to <hi>Biſhops-gate,</hi> where all the Companies of the City, in their ſeveral Liveries waited her coming, in their proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ranks, reaching from thence until the further end of <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> where ſhe was entertained with a peal of great Ordinance from the Tower. At her entrance into which place ſhe rendred her moſt humble
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53424:112"/> thanks to Almighty God, for the great and wondrous change of her condition, in bringing her from being a priſoner in that place, to be the Ruler of her people, and now to take poſſeſſion of it as a Royal Palace. Here ſhe remained till <hi>December</hi> the fifth, then next following, and from thence removed by water to <hi>Sommerſet-houſe.</hi> In each remove ſhe found ſuch infinite throngs of people, which flocked from all parts to ſee her, both by land and water, and teſtified their publick joy, by ſuch loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, as much rejoyced her heart to hear, and could not but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it in her words and countenance.</p>
               <p>As ſhe paſſed through <hi>London,</hi> the Bible was preſented to her at the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Conduit in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> which ſhe received with both her hands; and kiſſing it, laid it to her breaſt, ſaying, <hi>That the ſame had ever been her delight, and ſhould be the rule by which ſhe meant to frame her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Many who were impriſoned for Religion, ſhe reſtored to liberty at her firſt coming to the Crown: which occaſioned <hi>Rainsford,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Court, to make a ſute to her in the behalf of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who had been long impriſoned in a Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, that they alſo might walk abroad (as formerly) in the Engliſh Tongue.

               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> fearing leaſt he ſhould loſe the ſtrength and title of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and that the Kingdom of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> would by <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> be annexed unto <hi>France,</hi> dealt ſeriouſly with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> about a Marriage to be contracted with her, promiſing to procure a ſpecial diſpenſation from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Queen weighing in her mind the unlawfulneſs of ſuch a Marriage, puts off King <hi>Philip</hi> by little and little, with a modeſt anſwer, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed out of ſcruple of Conſcience. And now ſhe thought nothing more pleaſing to God, than that Religion ſhould be forthwith be altered. Thereupon the care of correcting the Liturgy, was committed to Doctor <hi>Matthew Parker, Bill, May, Grindal, Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>Pilkinton,</hi> Learned and moderate Divines, and to Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Knight; the matter being imparted to no man, but the Marqueſs of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Sir <hi>John Grey</hi> of <hi>Pyrgo,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cecil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Parliament was ſummoned to begin on <hi>January</hi> 25. which opened with an Eloquent and Learned Sermon, Preached by Dr. <hi>Cox.</hi> In the Houſe of Commons there were ſome furious Spirits, who eagerly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all propoſitions, which ſeemed to tend unto the prejudice of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of which number none ſo violent as <hi>Scory,</hi> Doctor of the Laws, and a Great Inſtrument of <hi>Bonner's</hi> Butcheries in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Reign: who being queſtioned for the cruelty of his Executions, declared himſelf to be ſorry for nothing more, <hi>That inſtead of lopping off ſome few boughes and branches, he did not lay his Ax to the Root of the Tree:</hi> Yet paſſed He unpuniſhed for the preſent, though Divine Vengeance brought him in the end to his juſt reward.</p>
               <p>In this Parliament paſſed an Act for recognizing the Queen's juſt Title to the Crown, but without any Act for the validity of her Mother's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, on which her Title moſt depended.</p>
               <p>There paſſed an Act alſo for reſtoring the Tenths, and firſt Fruits, to the Crown; firſt ſetled thereon in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and afterwards given back by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the Pope.</p>
               <p>They paſſed an Act alſo for the diſſolution of all ſuch Monaſteries, Convents, and Religious Orders, as had been Founded and eſtabliſhed by Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> By vertue of which Act Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of all thoſe Lands, which had been granted by her Siſter, to the

               </p>
               <p>In paſſing the Act of the Supremacy there was ſome trouble; it ſeemed to be a thing even abhorrent in Nature and Polity, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be declared to be the Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But the Queen declined the Title of Head, and aſſumed the name of Governor of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This Act having ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſſed the Houſe of Commons, found none of the Temporal Lords in the Houſe of Lords to oppoſe it, ſave onely the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Brown</hi> Viſcount <hi>Montacute.</hi> As for the Biſhops, there were but fourteen, and the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> then alive: of whom four being abſent, the reſt could not make any conſiderable oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>In the Convocation of the Clergy there paſſed certain Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they tendered to the Parliament, which were theſe.</p>

               <p>Beſides the Diſputants, there were preſent many of the Lords of the Queens Council, with other of the Nobility, as alſo many of the lower Houſe of Parliament. For the manner of their conference, it was agreed it ſhould be performed in writing, and that the Biſhops ſhould deliver their Reaſons in writing firſt. Many differences aroſe between them, ſo that the conference broke off, and nothing was determined. The Biſhops of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter</hi> thought meet, that the Queen and the Authors of this defection from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould be Excommunicated, who for this cauſe were impriſoned.</p>
               <p>Then a Peace being made, was Proclaimed over all <hi>England,</hi> betwixt the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Daulphin, and the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> The Parliament being diſſolved, by Authority of the ſame the Liturgy was forthwith brought into the Churches in the Vulgar Tongue; the Oath of Supremacy offered to the Popiſh Biſhops, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53424:115"/> others of the Eccleſiaſtical profeſſion, which moſt of them had ſworn unto, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. All the Biſhops refuſed, except <hi>Anthony</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As many as refuſed, were turned out of their Livings, Dignities, Biſhopricks.</p>

                  <hi>Nicholas Health</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> lived privately many years in his Mannor of <hi>Chobham</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> never reſtrained to any one place, and died in great favour with the Queen, who beſtowed many gratious viſits upon him, during his retirement. <hi>Tonſtal</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> ſpent the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his time with Archbiſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> by whom he was kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and honourably buried. The like civility was afforded to <hi>Thurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> in the ſame houſe, and unto <hi>Bourn</hi> of <hi>Wells,</hi> by the Dean of <hi>Exon,</hi> in which two houſes they both died about ten years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>White,</hi> though at firſt impriſoned for his faults, after ſome cooling himſelf in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> was ſuffered to enjoy his liberty, and to retire himſelf to what friend he pleaſed: Which favour was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto <hi>Turbervil</hi> alſo, who being a Gentleman by extraction wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not friends to give him good entertainment. <hi>Watſon</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort reſtraint, ſpent the remainder of his time with the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and <hi>Ely;</hi> till having practiſed againſt the State, he was ſhut up in the Caſtle of <hi>VVisbich,</hi> where at laſt he died. <hi>Oglethorp</hi> died ſoon after his deprivation, of an <hi>Apoplexy, Bayn</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> in <hi>December</hi> following. <hi>Pool</hi> enjoyed the like freedom, and died in a good old age. <hi>Chriſtopherſon</hi> lived on his Eſtate. <hi>Bonner</hi> alone was doomed to a perpetual impriſonment; the priſon proving to that wretch (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin)</hi> his greateſt Sanctuary, whoſe horrid Butcheries had otherwiſe expoſed him to the popular ſury.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:53424:115"/>
               <p>We find no more to have been deprived of their preferments, than fourteen Biſhops, ſix Abbots, Priors, and Governors of Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, twelve Deans, and as many Archdeacons, fifteen Preſidents or Maſters of Colledges, fifty Prebendaries of Cathedral Churches, and about eighty Parſons or Vicars. The whole number not amounting to two hundred men, which in a Realm conſiſting of nine thouſand Pariſhes, and twenty ſix Cathedral Churches, could be no great matter.</p>
               <p>But there was not a ſufficient number of Learned men to ſupply the <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>P. Heylins</hi> Hiſtory of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
                  </note> Cures, which filled the Church with an Ignorant Clergy, whoſe Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning went no further than the Liturgy, or the Book of Homilies, but otherwiſe conformable (which was no ſmall felicity) to the Rules of the Church. And on the other ſide many were raiſed to great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who having ſpent their time of exile in ſuch Forreign Churches as followed the platform of <hi>Geneva;</hi> returned ſo diſaffected to Epiſcopal Government, unto the Rites here by Law eſtabliſhed, as not long after filled the Church with moſt ſad diſorders: On which account we find the Queens Profeſſor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> among the Non-conformiſts, and <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>'s in <hi>Cambridge. VVhittingham</hi> the Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Franckfort</hi> dividers, was preferred to the Deanery of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: Sampſon</hi> to the Deanery of <hi>Chriſt-church,</hi> and within few years after turned out for a rigid Non-conformiſt. <hi>Hardiman,</hi> one of the firſt twelve Prebendaries of the Church of <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> deprived ſoon after for throwing down the Altar, and defacing the Veſtments of the Church.</p>
               <p>Whether it were by the Pope's inſtigation, or by by the ambition of the Daulphin who had then Married the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Scottiſh Queen aſſumeth unto her ſelf the Style and Title of Queen of <hi>England,</hi> quartereth the Armes thereof upon all her Plate, and in all Armories and Eſchutcheons as ſhe had occaſion. A folly that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> could never forget nor forgive; and this engaged her the more reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Reformation ſo happily begun. And to that purpoſe ſhe ſets out by advice of her Council a certain Body of Injunctions, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the temper of the preſent time: wherein ſevere courſe was taken about Miniſters Marriages, the uſe of Singing, and the Reverence in Divine Worſhip to be kept in Churches; the poſture of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-table, and the Form of Prayers in the Congregation.</p>
               <p>By the Injunctions, ſhe made way to her Viſitation, Executed by Commiſſioners in their ſeveral Circuits, and regulated by a Book of Articles printed and publiſhed for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Proceeding by which Articles, the Commiſſioners removed all carved Images out of the Church, which had been abuſed to Superſtition, defacing, alſo all ſuch Pictures, Paintings, as ſerved for the ſetting forth feigned Miracles.

               <p>In <hi>London,</hi> the Viſitors were Sir <hi>Richard Sackvil,</hi> Father to <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorſet; Robert Horn,</hi> ſoon after Biſhop of <hi>VVincheſter;</hi> Doctor <hi>Huick,</hi> a Civilian; and one <hi>Salvage,</hi> a Common Lawyer; who calling before them divers Perſons of every Pariſh, gave them an Oath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and preſent upon ſuch Articles and Injunctions as were given unto them. In purſuance whereof they burnt in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and other places of the City, all the Roods and other Images which had been taken out of the Churches. And in ſome places the Copes, Veſtments, Altar-cloathes, Books, Banners, Sepulchres, and Rood-lofts were burned altogether.</p>
               <p>A Peace being concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> although Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had juſt cauſe to be offended with the young King <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, for cauſing the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> his Wiſe, to take upon her ſelf the Title and Armes of <hi>England,</hi> yet ſhe reſolved to beſtow a Royal obſequy upon the King deceaſed, which was performed in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church on the eighth and nineth of <hi>September</hi> in moſt ſolemn manner.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſlaunderers knew right well, that nothing did more juſtifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the eye of the World, than that it did preſerve a Succeſſion of Biſhops, and conſequently of all other ſacred Orders in the Miniſtration; without which as they would not grant it to be a Church, ſo could they prove it to be none by no ſtronger Argument, than that the Biſhops (or the pretended Biſhops rather in their Opinion) were either not Conſecrate at all, or not Canonically Conſecrated as they ought to be.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:53424:116"/>

The Altar furniſhed with rich Plate, two fair gilt Candleſticks with Tapers in them, and a Maſſy Crucifix in midſt thereof: Which laſt remained there for ſome years.

               <p>Such of the Scots as deſired a Reformation of Religion, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the Queen's abſcence, and want of power in the Queen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ſuppreſs their practices, had put themſelves into a Body. Headed by ſome of the Nobility, they take unto themſelves the name of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> managing their own Affairs apart from the reſt of the Kingdom. They petition the Queen Regent, and the Lords of the Council, that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper might be adminiſtred in both kinds. That divine Offices might be celebrated in the vulgar Tongue, and that they might have the choice of their own Miniſters. The chief of the party well backed by the common people, put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into <hi>Perth,</hi> the news whereof occaſioneth Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to leave <hi>Geneva,</hi> and joyn himſelf to the Lords of the <hi>Congregation.</hi> At <hi>Perth</hi> he Preacheth againſt Images, Idolatry, and other Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo bitterly, that the people in a popular fury deface all the Images in that Church, and preſently demoliſh all Religious Houſes in that City. Thoſe of <hi>Couper</hi> hearing of it, forthwith deſtroyed all Images, and pulled down the Altars in that Church alſo. The like was done after his Preaching at <hi>Craile</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in thoſe places. They burnt down the rich Monaſtery of <hi>Scone,</hi> and ruined that of <hi>Cambusken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> demoliſhed all the Altars, Images, and Covents of Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in <hi>Sterling, Lithgow, Glaſcough, Edenburgh,</hi> which laſt they poſſeſs, and put up their own Preachers into all the Pulpits of that City, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Queen Regent to have the uſe of one Church onely for her own devotions. They alſe deprive the Queen Regent of all place and power in the publick Government. But ſhe gathering Forces recovereth <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and the chief key of all that Kingdom gariſoned by the French. In their extremity <hi>Maitland</hi> and <hi>Melvin</hi> being diſpatched to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> imploring aid from Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And an Army is ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> of ſix thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord <hi>Gray.</hi> Some Ships were alſo ſent to block up the haven, and hinder all Relief which might come by Sea to the Town of <hi>Leith.</hi> At length after divers Articles ſigned and confirmed for both Kingdoms, the French take their leave of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Engliſh Army was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded at <hi>Berwick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Congregation</hi> was by the Queen put upon a preſent confidence of going vigorouſly on in their Reformation, ſo it concern'd them to proceed ſo carefully in purſuance of it, as might comply with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance which they had upon her.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore they bound themſelves by their ſubſcription to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Liturgy, with all the Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which for a time remained the onely form of Worſhip for the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>In the next place, They cauſe a Parliament to be called in the moneth of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> for the Boroughs there appeared the accuſtomed number.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53424:117"/> but of the Lords Spiritual no more than ſix Biſhops of thirteen, with thirteen Abbots and Priors: and the Temporal Lords to the number of ten Earls, and as many Barons.</p>
               <p>Three Acts were paſſed to the advantage of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>The firſt, was for the aboliſhing the Pope's Juriſdiction and Authority within the Realm.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, for annulling all Statutes made in former times for maintenance of Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>
               <p>The third, for the puniſhing the Sayers and Hearers of the Maſs.</p>
               <p>To this Parliament alſo ſome of the Miniſters preſented a Confeſſion of the Faith and Doctrine to be believed and profeſſed by the Proteſtants of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland:</hi> which being put to the Vote, was oppoſed but by three of the Temporal Lords. The Popiſh Prelates were ſilent in it: which being obſerved by the Earl Marſhal, he broke out into theſe words, <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>that my Lords the Biſhops, who by their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can, and for the zeal they ſhould have to the Truth, ought, as I ſuppoſe, to gainſay any thing repugnant to it, ſay nothing againſt the Confeſſion we have heard, I cannot think but that it is the very Truth of God, and that the contrary of it is falſe Doctrine.</hi>

               <p>This Chalenge being publiſhed in ſo great an Auditory ſtartled the Engliſh Papiſts both at home and abroad. The buſineſs was firſt agitated by the exchange of friendly Letters betwixt Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Henry Cole,</hi> the late Dean of St. <hi>Pauls;</hi> more violently followed in a Book of <hi>Raſtals;</hi> followed therein by <hi>Dorman</hi> and <hi>Marſhal: Dorman</hi> was well anſwered and foiled by <hi>Nowel,</hi> and the other by <hi>Calfhil.</hi> But the main encounter was between the Chalenger himſelf and Dr. <hi>John Harding,</hi> who had the better of the day will eaſily appear to any that conſults their Writings: But theſe Diſcourſes came not out till ſome years after.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth dying, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth ſucceedeth him, who being moved to Excommunicate Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the Count of

                  <hi>Feria,</hi> takes a more moderate courſe, by ſending <hi>Vincent Parpalia,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of St. <hi>Saviour's,</hi> with courteous Letters unto her. <hi>Parpalia</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to offer in the Name of the Pope, That the Engliſh Liturgy ſhould be confirmed, the uſe of the Communion in both kinds allowed of: And that all ſentences paſſed, in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be reſcinded, upon condition ſhe would own the Pope's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and cordially unite her ſelf to the Catholick Church: yea ſome thouſands of Crowns (but all in vain) were promiſed to the effecters thereof. But for all this the Abbot came no nearer than <hi>Bruxels</hi> with his Bulls and Faculties, not being ſuffered to ſet Foot on Engliſh ground.</p>
               <p>Now another Enemy quarrels at the Rites and Extrinſecals of the Church: Thoſe that for Religion fled to <hi>Frankford</hi> in Queen <hi>Marie's</hi> days, after her death haſtened into <hi>England:</hi> followed not long after by the Brethren of the Separation, which retired from thence unto <hi>Geneva.</hi> Some Friends they had about the Queen, and <hi>Calvin</hi> make's uſe of all his power and credit, both with the Queen and <hi>Cecil</hi> (as appears by his Letters unto both) to advance their ends. And he was ſeconded therein by <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> But the Queen reſolved to keep up the Church in ſuch outward ſplendor, as might make it every way conſiderable in the eye of the World: when therefore they ſaw the Liturgy impoſed by Act of Parliament, and ſo many Epiſcopal Sees ſupplied with able Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, they began to revive the quarrels raiſed in King <hi>Edward's</hi> time, about Caps, and Surplices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin.</hi> And herein they were ſeconded (as before in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time) by the ſame <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> as appears by his Letters to a nameleſs friend, bearing date at <hi>Zurich, November</hi> 5. 1560. to which he added his diſlike in another of his Letters, touching the Cap, the Epiſcopal Habit, the Churche's Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: the manner of proceeding to be held againſt Papiſts; the Peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation uſed in the Rogation week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which his judgement was deſired.</p>
               <p>But theſe helps being too far off, another project was ſet on foot. <hi>Gryndal,</hi> the new Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was known to have a great reſpect to <hi>Calvin;</hi> the buſineſs therefore is ſo ordered, that by <hi>Calvin's</hi> Letters to <hi>Gryndal,</hi> and the friends they had about the Queen, way ſhould be given to ſuch of the French Nation, as had repaired hither; to enjoy the freedom of their own Religion, to have a Church unto themſelves, and in that Church not onely to erect the <hi>Genevian</hi> Diſcipline, but to ſet up a Form of Prayer (ſaith Dr. <hi>Heylin)</hi> which ſhould hold no conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Engliſh Liturgy. This was effected. And now there is another Church in <hi>London,</hi> as different from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Government and Forms of worſhip, as that of <hi>John Alaſco</hi> was in the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Friars.</p>

               <p>The death of <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, the young King of <hi>France,</hi> who had married <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of Scots, encouraged the Scots to proceed boldly with their Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> laboured with the Pope to fulminate his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as one that had renounced his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, apoſtatized from the Catholick Religion, and utterly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the profeſſion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About this time one <hi>Geoffrys</hi> was committed Priſoner to the Marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and <hi>More</hi> to the houſe of Mad-men (commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bethlem)</hi> without Biſhop's-gate in <hi>London.

Having remained a whole year in priſon, without ſhewing any ſign of their repentance, <hi>Geoffrys</hi> was whipt, on <hi>April</hi> 10. 1561. from the ſaid Marſhalſey to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> with a paper bound about his head, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, That this was <hi>William Geoffrys,</hi> a moſt blaſphemous Heretick, who denied Chriſt to be in Heaven At <hi>Bethlem</hi> he was whipt again in the preſence of <hi>More,</hi> till the laſh had extorted from him a confeſſion of his damnable error. After which <hi>More</hi> was ſtript and whipt in the open Streets, till he had made the like acknowledgment, confeſſing Chriſt to be in Heaven, and Himſelf to be a vile, ſinful man. Which being done, they were again remitted to their ſeveral priſons for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cure.</p>
               <p>On <hi>June</hi> the fourth, a lamentable fire about four a Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, firſt ſhewed it ſelf near the top of the Steeple of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> and from thence burnt down the Spire, to the Stone-work and Bells, and raged ſo terribly, that within the ſpace of four hours the Timber and Lead of the whole Church, and whatſoever elſe was combuſtible in it, was miſerably conſumed, to the great terror of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: Which Church ſaid to be the largeſt in all the Chriſtian World for all dimenſions, contains in length ſeven hundred and twenty foot, in breadth one hundred and thirty foot, and in height from the pavement to the top of the roof one hundred and fifty foot. The Steeple from the ground to the Croſs or Weather-cock, contained in height five hundred and twenty foot, of which the ſquare Tower onely amounted to two hundred and ſixty, the Pyramide or Spire to as many more; which Spire being raiſed of maſſy Timber, and covered over with ſheets of Lead, as it was the more apt to be enflamed, ſo was the miſchief more incapable of a preſent remedy.</p>
               <p>The Queen hereupon directed her Letters to the Lord Mayor and City of <hi>London</hi> to take care therein. In obedience to whoſe Royal Pleaſure the Citizens granted a Benevolence, and three Fifteens to be ſpeedily paid, beſides the great bounty of particular perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Queen
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53424:120"/> alſo ſent in a thouſand Marks in ready money, and Warrants for one thouſand load of Timber to be ſerved out of Her Majeſties Woods. The Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> contributing to this work the fortieth part of their Benefices which ſtood charged with firſt-fruits, and the thirtieth part of thoſe which had paid the ſame. The Clergy of the Dioceſs of <hi>London</hi> beſtowed the thirtieth part of ſuch of their livings as were under the burden of that payment, and the twentieth part of thoſe which were not. To which the Biſhop added at ſeveral times the ſum of nine hundred pound one ſhilling eleven pence, the Dean and Chapter one hundred thirty ſix pound thirteen ſhillings four pence. By all which, and ſome other little helps, the work was carried on ſo faſt, that before the end of <hi>April</hi> 1566. the Timber-work of the Roof was not onely fitted, but compleatly covered.</p>
               <p>And now the Pope's Nuncio being advanced already in his way to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as far as <hi>Flanders,</hi> expecteth the Queen's pleaſure touching his admittance: for the Pope could not be taken off from ſending his Nuncio to the Queen, with whom he conceived himſelf to ſtand upon termes of Amity. But the Queen perſevered in her firſt intent, affirming ſhe could not treat with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe authority was excluded out of <hi>England</hi> by conſent of Parliament. The greateſt obſtacle to the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's coming was partly laid by the indiſcretion of ſome Papiſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and partly by the precipitancy of the Pope's Miniſters in <hi>Ireland;</hi> for ſundry ill-diſpoſed perſons upon the noiſe of the Nuncio's coming, not onely brake the Laws made againſt the Pope and his Authority, but ſpread abroad ſlaunderous reports, that the Queen was at the point to change her Religion, and alter the government of the Realm. Some alſo had practiſed with the Devil by Conjurations, Charms, and caſting of Figures, to be informed in the length of her Majeſties Reign. And on the other ſide the Pope's Legate being at the ſame time in <hi>Ireland,</hi> joyned himſelf to ſome deſperate Traitors, who ſtirred up rebellion there, and as much as in him was had deprived the Queen of all Right and Title to that Kingdom. Upon which grounds it was carried clearly at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-boord againſt the Nuncio, notwithſtanding the Interceſſion of the French, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>

               <p>Yet notwithſtanding the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſends to perſwade the Queen to return to the old Religion, at leaſt that ſhe would ſet apart ſome Churches to the uſe of the Catholicks. To whom ſhe anſwered, <hi>That ſhe had ſetled her Religion on ſo ſure a Bottom, that ſhe could not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be changed, And for granting Churches to the Papiſts, it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the Polity and good Laws of the Land.</hi>

They were content it ſhould be given to the Scots, becauſe their Queen would demand it, but ſo as that the demand ſhould firſt be made. But the Engliſh Proteſtant Biſhops would not venture themſelves into that Council on ſuch weak aſſurance, conſidering how ill the ſafe conduct had been formerly kept to <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> at the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> And the Queen kept the Papal party ſafe from gadding thither.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Scipio,</hi> a Venetian Gentleman (formerly acquainted with Maſter <hi>Jewel,</hi> whil'ſt he was a Student at <hi>Padua)</hi> wrote now an expoſtulating Letter unto him, being lately made Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> in which he much admireth, that <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſend no Ambaſſador, nor Letter, nor Meſſage, to excuſe their Nation's abſence from the General Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſtianity in that Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> returned him ſuch an Anſwer, that neither <hi>Scipio</hi> himſelf, nor any other of that party durſt reply upon him. The Anſwer is to be found at large at the end of the Hiſtory of this Council, Tranſlated by Sir <hi>Nathanael Brent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time it was adviſed, by <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> and other principal leaders of the Proteſtant party in <hi>France,</hi> that they ſhould put themſelves under the protection of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who had not long before ſo ſeaſonably relieved the Scots in the like diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The Queen had been ſecretly advertiſed of all paſſages there by Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton,</hi> her Majeſtie's Reſident in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It being agreed on between them, that the Queen ſhould ſupply the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and his Aſſociates with a ſufficient quantity of Money, Corn, and Ammunition, for the ſervice of the French King, againſt the practices of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and that the Town of <hi>New-haven</hi> ſhould be put into her Majeſtie's hands, to be garriſoned by Engliſh Souldiers. Immediately a manifeſt was publiſhed in the name of the Queen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was declared, that ſhe had obſerved, how the Guiſian Faction, in the names of the Queen-Mother of <hi>France,</hi> and the young King, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to root out the Profeſſors of the Reformed Religion, and what maſſacres had been made at <hi>Vaſſey, Paris, Sene, Tholouſe, Bloys, Touers, Angier,</hi> and other places; that there were thought to be Butchered no leſs than an hundred thouſand of the natural Franch, between the firſt of <hi>March</hi> and the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> then laſt paſt: that with the like violence they had cauſed to be ſpoiled and impriſoned ſuch of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's Subjects as Traded in the Ports of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and ſuch as ſought to preſerve themſelves, to be killed, their goods and Merchandize to be ſeized, without charging any other crime upon them but that they were Hugonots; and that in conſideration of the premiſes ſhe could do no leſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53424:122"/> than endeavour the preſerving the Reformed Religion, from an univerſal deſtruction, and the maintaining her own Subjects and Dominions in peace and ſafety. The ayd amounting to ſix thouſand men, was divided into two equal parts, of which the one was deſtined to the defence of <hi>Roven</hi> and <hi>Deep,</hi> then being in the hands of the Confederates, the other to take poſſeſſion of the Town of <hi>New-haven,</hi> which by the Inhabitants was joyfully ſurrendred to the Engliſh. The Lord <hi>Ambroſe Dudley,</hi> the eldeſt Son then living of the late Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ſhe ſent to command that place, whom on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. She had created Lord <hi>Liſle,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he was ſolemnly received with a peal of Ordnance.</p>
               <p>A petit Rebellion hapned in <hi>Merton-colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> The War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſhip of that houſe being voyd by the death of <hi>Gervaſe,</hi> one <hi>Man</hi> is choſen to the place; one <hi>Hall</hi> and his Popiſh faction oppoſed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and raiſed ſuch a perſecution, that it was poenal for any to be a Proteſtant. Archbiſhop <hi>Parker</hi> hearing of it, ſummoneth <hi>Hall</hi> to appear before him, but the ſeal of the citation was torn off by ſome of that party. Hereupon the Archbiſhop made a ſolemn viſitation of that Colledge, wherein all were generally examined, <hi>Man</hi> confirmed <hi>Warden, Hall</hi> juſtly expelled, his party publickly admoniſhed; the young Scholars relieved, Papiſts curbed and ſuppreſſed, Proteſtants countenanced, and encouraged in the whole Univerſity.</p>
               <p>Now many ſtrange whiſpers were abroad, and no ſmall hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by thoſe of the Popiſh faction, for ſuppreſſing the Proteſtants in all parts of the Kingdom, and ſetting up their own Religion as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: of the plot were <hi>Arthur Pool,</hi> younger brother to <hi>Reginald Pool</hi> the late Cardinal Legate, and <hi>Geoffry Forteſcue,</hi> who had married his ſiſter, and others. The ſubſtance of their charge was, a deſign of levying War againſt the Queen, &amp;c. with a particular intention of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Pool</hi> himſelf unto the Title of Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> All which they Confeſſed upon the Indictment, and did all receive the ſentence of death; but were all afterwards pardoned by the Queen, out of that great reſpect which ſhe bare to their Royal Extraction.</p>
               <p>Then was that elegant diſcourſe publiſhed by Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Entitled, The Apology of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> firſt writ in <hi>Latine,</hi> tranſlated preſently into <hi>Engliſh, French, Italian, Dutch,</hi> and at laſt in <hi>Greek,</hi> to the publiſhing whereof he was much encouraged by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> with whom he had ſpent the greateſt part of his time when he lived in exile. But <hi>Martyr</hi> lived onely to ſee the Book which he ſo much longed for, dying at <hi>Zurich</hi> on the twelfth of <hi>November</hi> following, and laid into his grave by the Magiſtrates and people of that City with a ſolemn funeral.</p>
               <p>The five Biſhopricks erected by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, were ſo
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53424:122"/> impoveriſhed in this Queen's Reign that the new Biſhops were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to require the benevolence of their Clergy at their firſt coming to them, to furniſh their Epiſcopal houſes, and to enable them to maintain ſome tolerable degree of Hoſpitality in their ſeveral Dioceſſes.</p>
               <p>The Parliament called <hi>January</hi> 12. 1562. paſſed an Act <hi>for Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Queen's Royal power over all Eſtates and Subjects in her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</hi> In which it was provided, That no man Reſiding in the Queen's Dominions, ſhould from thence-forth either by-word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c. endeavour willingly to maintain the power and juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> heretofore uſurped within this Realm. It was alſo enacted, that none ſhould be admitted unto Holy Orders, or to any Degree in either of the Univerſities, or to be Barreſter, or Bencher in any of the Inns of Court, or to Practiſe as an Attourney, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> till He or They ſhould firſt take the Oath of Supremacy on the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts; with a power given to every Archbiſhop and Biſhop within this Realm and the Dominions of the ſame, to Miniſter the ſaid Oath to all and every Spiritual Perſon in their proper Dioceſſes, as well in places exempt as elſ-where; It had been declared by the Biſhops and Clergy aſſembled at the ſame time in their Convocation, To be a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God, and the Cuſtom of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, <hi>to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to adminiſter the Sacraments in a Tongue not underſtood by the People:</hi> therefore it was En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That the Biſhops of <hi>Hereford,</hi> S. <hi>David's, Bangor, Landaff</hi> and S. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> ſhould take care for Tranſlating the whole Bible with the Common-prayer-book, into the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue: The like care was alſo taken for Tranſlating the Books of Homilies.</p>
               <p>Then were the Nine and thirty Articles (compoſed in the Convocation <note place="margin">The 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles compiled in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at <hi>London)</hi> publiſhed ſoon after both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Latine with this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Title, <hi>viz.</hi> Articles agreed upon by the Archiſhops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergy in the Convocation holden at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1562. for the avoyding of Diverſities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and eſtabliſhing conſent touching true Religion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Articles came forth much about the time that the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were publiſhed. Many of which Decrees begin with lying, and all end with Curſing, threatening <hi>Anathema</hi>'s to all diſſenters. <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. the Parliament confirmed theſe Articles ſo far, that every Clerk ſhould before <hi>Decemb.</hi> 25. next following ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſame.

This ſubſcription was extended only to men of Eccleſiaſtical Function.</p>
               <p>After the return of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53424:123"/> Beſides the Ratifying the Act of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> (formerly condeſcended to in the Treaty at <hi>Edenburgh)</hi> there were alſo paſt ſome other Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> one Act for repairing and upholding Pariſh Churches, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards of the ſame for burial of the dead. Another againſt letting Parſonages, Gleabes, or Houſes, into long Leaſes or Fee. But on the other ſide no ſafety or Protection could be found for the Queen's own Religion, no not ſo much as the Chappel Royal, or the Regal City. In contempt whereof a force was violently committed in the moneth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the Chappel of the Palace of <hi>Holy-rood</hi> houſe, where certain of the Queen's ſervants were aſſembled for their own devotions, the doors broke open, ſome of the Company haled to the next priſon, and the reſt diſperſed, the Prieſt eſcaping with difficulty by a private paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, the Queen being then abſent in the North.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> the City and Caſtle of <hi>Cane</hi> beſieged by the confederate forces both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was finally ſurrendred to the Admiral <hi>Chaſtilion</hi> to the uſe of the Princes.

Theſe ſucceſſes amazed the <hi>Guiſian</hi> faction, that they agreed unto an Edict of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by the which the <hi>French</hi> forces were reſtored to the King's Favour, the Hugonots to the free exerciſe of their own Religion. But they muſt buy this happineſs by betraying the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom they had brought into the Countrey, and joyn their forces with the reſt to drive them out of <hi>New-haven,</hi> if they would not yield it on demand. The <hi>French</hi> cloſely beſiege the Town, and the Plague raging ſore among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they capitulate, and leave the Town to the <hi>French</hi> on <hi>July</hi> the twenty ninth, and carry the Plague with them into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Pope was ſo incenſed againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a commiſſion to the Fathers of <hi>Trent,</hi> to proceed to an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication <note place="margin">Hiſt. Concil. <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Plague brought out of <hi>France</hi> by the Garriſon Souldiers of <hi>New-haven,</hi> had ſo diſperſed it ſelf, and made ſuch deſolation in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> that it ſwept away above twenty thouſand of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53424:123"/> City of <hi>London,</hi> which was the greateſt at that time which any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving could remember. Soon after this the Queen makes peace with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Queen went in progreſs to take the pleaſures of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and viſited the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where being with all kinds of honour received by the Students, and delighted with Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Tragedies, and Scholaſtical diſputations, ſhe ſurvayed every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and in a Latine Oration takes her leave of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> giving them encouragement to purſue their Studies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops being impowered by their Canons, began to ſhew their Authority in urging the Clergy of their Dioceſſes, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Liturgy, Rites, and diſcipline of the Church; and ſuch as refuſed the ſame were branded with the name of Puritans.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> in this Age were divided into two Ranks: ſome mild and moderate, contented onely to enjoy their own conſcience. Others fierce and fiery, to the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The old man produced the New Teſtament in Greek, To this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I ſubſcribe.</hi> But when a ſubſcription to the Canons was ſubſcribed of him, he refuſed it, ſaying, <hi>I have nothing in the Church ſave a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend at</hi> Salisbury: <hi>and much good may it do you, if you will take it away from me.</hi> However ſuch reſpect did the Biſhops (moſt formerly his fellow-exiles) bear to his Age, parts, and pains, that he continued his place till the day of his death.

Yet find we none of them ſilenced; Onely we meet with <hi>Thomas Sampſon</hi> Dean of <hi>Chriſt-church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was diſplaced out of his Deanery for his Non-conformity.

               <p>Now the Queen thought fit to make a further ſignification of Her Royal Pleaſure, legally declared by Her Commiſſioners for cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, according to the Acts and Statutes made in that behalf.

               <p>Now we are come to the ſetling the Epiſcopal Government by as good Authority as could be given to it by the Lawes of the Land.

On the refuſal of which Oath he is Indicted at the King's Bench upon the Statute, to which he appeared in ſome Term in the year foregoing, and deſires that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be aſſigned to plead his cauſe.

               <p>But the buſineſs came under conſideration in the following Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which began on <hi>September</hi> thirty, where the Legality of <hi>Horn</hi>'s Epiſcopacy (which was objected againſt in the behalf of <hi>Bonner)</hi> was cleered by Statute, by which the Parliament did only publiſh, notifie, and declare the Legal Authority of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, whoſe call and Conſecration to their place was formerly performed.</p>

               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and <hi>Charles Nevil</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi> brake out into open Rebellion againſt the Queen. Their
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53424:125"/> firſt valour was to fight againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible and Service-book in <hi>Durham,</hi> tearing them to pieces. They ſet up Maſs in moſt places where they came, <hi>Richard Norton</hi> an aged Gentleman carrying the Croſs before them, and others bearing in their banners the five wounds of Chriſt, or a Chalice, according to their different devices. But the Earl of <hi>Suſſex</hi> advancing out of the South with an Army to oppoſe them, they fled Northwards, and mouldered away to nothing. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> lurked there awhile, was betrayed to Earl <hi>Murrey,</hi> ſent back into <hi>England,</hi> and beheaded at <hi>York.

               <p>Commiſſioners were appointed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to take cognizance of the cauſe of the Queen of <hi>Scots, Murrey</hi> cometh to <hi>York</hi> being the City appointed for that purpoſe, and with him ſeven of his Inwardeſt friends as Delegates for the Infant-King; and for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Delegates alſo appeared.

               <p>The third Colledge was founded by <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Valladolit</hi> in old <hi>Caſtile.

               <p>The ſeventh, a Colledge of <hi>Lovain</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> founded 1606. by <hi>Philip</hi> the third, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who gave a Caſtle, with a Penſion, to the Engliſh Jeſuits, to build them a Colledge therewith.</p>
               <p>The eighth Colledge was at <hi>Liege</hi> in <hi>Lukeland,</hi> founded 1616. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Collen</hi> (being at this time alſo Biſhop of <hi>Liege)</hi> gave them a Penſion to live on, and leave to build a fair Colledge here. Many of the Engliſh Nobility and Gentry, under pretence of paſſing to the <hi>Spaw</hi> to recover their healths, dropped here much of their Gold by the way.</p>
               <p>The ninth Colledge was of <hi>Gaunt</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> founded 1624. by <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, who gave them a Penſion.</p>

A Convocation was kept in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>London;</hi> and from hence removed to St. <hi>Peter's</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where <hi>William Redman</hi> D. D. was choſen and preſented Prolocutor. An Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Miniſters met at the ſame time: but the certain place of their meeting not known, being Clandeſtine, Arbitrary, and changeable, as adviſed by their Conveniences. Some Agents for them were all day at the door of the Parliament-houſe, and ſome part of the night in the Chambers of Parliament-men, effectually ſolliciting their buſineſs with them.</p>
               <p>What impreſſion was made by the Agents of the Miniſters, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by an enſuing Letter ſent to her Majeſty, by Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> wherein he complaineth of ſeveral Bills that had, the day before the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Letter, paſſed in the Houſe of Commons, in favour of the Non-conformiſts, about Marrying at all times in the year, concerning
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53424:133"/> Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and Epiſcopal Viſitations, which <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> may reach to the overthrow of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and ſtudy of the Civil Law. But the Queen would alter nothing material to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government.</p>
               <p>The Parliament being diſſolved, the Convocation ended the next day after, having effected nothing of moment, ſave that in the ninth Seſſion thereof <hi>John Hilton</hi> Prieſt, made a ſolemn Abjuration of his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Hereſies.</p>
               <p>The Non-conformiſts now miſſing their mark, abated much of their former Activity; inſomuch as that Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> began to make by the mediation of the Earl of <hi>Lei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> went over into the Low Countries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a great Army, with the Title of <hi>General of the Auxiliaries of the Queen of</hi> England; and the Non-conformiſts loſt their beſt friend in Court. And afterwards the Archbiſhop being ſworn one of the Privy Council, it fared worſe with them.</p>
               <p>Three Proteſtant Biſhops died this year, <hi>viz. Richard Curteys,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter; Nicholas Robinſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor;</hi> and <hi>John Scory,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford.</hi> The ſame year alſo died <hi>John Fecknam,</hi> late Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jeſuites began now to poſſeſs their Engliſh Proſelites, with high Opinions of the Spaniſh power, as the Nation deſigned by God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to work their reſtitution in <hi>England:</hi> and they ſent into <hi>England</hi> (as <hi>Paſquier</hi> ſaith) one <hi>Samier,</hi> a man of their Society, to draw Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Gentlemen to the Spaniards party, and to thruſt forward the Queen of Scots to dangerous practices, by telling her, <hi>That if ſhe were refractory, neither She nor her Son ſhould Reign:</hi> and by exciting the <hi>Guiſes</hi> her kinſmen to new ſtirs, againſt the King of <hi>Navar</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that they might not be able to ayd her.</p>
               <p>In the year 1586. a firm League of Amity was concluded and ratified betwixt the Queen of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A dangerous conſpiracy againſt the Queen of <hi>England</hi> (begun by <hi>John Savage,</hi> but proſecuted by <hi>Anthony Babington</hi> and others) was diſcovered. The chief diſcover of this Conſpiracy was one <hi>Gifford,</hi> a Gentleman of a good houſe at <hi>Chellington</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> not far from <hi>Chartley,</hi> where the Queen of Scots was kept priſoner. He was ſent by the Engliſh fugitives in <hi>France,</hi> under the counterfit name of <hi>Luſon,</hi> to put <hi>Savage</hi> in mind of the vow which he had made, to kill Queen
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53424:133"/> 
                  <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to convey Letters between them and the Queen of <hi>Scots. Gifford</hi> revealed the plot to Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> who ſent him down into <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> to do the work he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Gifford</hi> bribing the Brewer of the houſe where the Queen of Scots lay, ſo contrived the matter with him, that by a hole in the wall, in which a looſe ſtone was put, he ſhould give in, and receive forth Letters, the which, by Meſſengers purpoſely laid by the way, came ever to <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingham's</hi> hands, who broke them open, copied them out, and by the cunning of <hi>Thomas Philips,</hi> found out the meaning of the private Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: and by the Art of <hi>Arthur Gregory</hi> ſealed them up again, ſo neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no man could have imagined them to be opened, and ever ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In like manner were the former Letters from the Queen of Scots to <hi>Babington</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted; as alſo other Letters written at the ſame time to <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſco,</hi> and <hi>Francis Englefied.</hi> Then <hi>Ballard</hi> was apprehended. <hi>Babington</hi> ſeeks to eſcape, and is taken. The Queen of Scots hath her Cloſets broken open, and her Boxes ſearched. Fourteen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were Arraigned, Condemned of High-treaſon and executed. Afterwards in the Star-chamber ſentence was pronounced againſt the Queen of Scots. And in a Parliament preſently following, the Lords pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the Queen, that the ſentence paſſed againſt her may preſently be promulged. The King of Scots and the King of <hi>France</hi> ſollicit for her life. But when this would not prevail, <hi>L' Aubeſpine,</hi> the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador thinks no way ſo effectual, for ſaving the Queen of Scots life, as to take away the life of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The plot was diſcovered. And at length the Sentence againſt the Queen of Scots was put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhe ended her doleful life at <hi>Fothringhay</hi> Caſtle. She was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Quire of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wickham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> Preached her Funeral-ſermon. Some twenty yaars after King <hi>James</hi> cauſed her Corps to be ſolemnly removed from <hi>Poterborough</hi> to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where in the South-ſide of the Chappel of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, he erected a ſtately Monument to her Memory.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> having raiſed great offence, is called home again into <hi>England</hi> by the Queen, giveth over his Government, and the free Adminiſtration of his Government is left to the States.</p>
               <p>Now Conformity was preſſed to the height. The power of the High <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fuller.</hi> Church Hiſt. in <hi>An.</hi> 1537.</note> Commiſſion began to extend far, and penalties to fall heavy on offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: whereupon the favourers of Non-conformiſts much oppoſed it in their Printed Books; ſome queſtioning the Court as not warranted by Law; others taxing their proceedings, as exceeding their Commiſſion. But the moſt general exception againſt the High Commiſſion was this,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53424:134"/> That proceeding, <hi>Ex Officio mero,</hi> by way of enquiry againſt ſuch whom they ſuſpected, they tendred unto them an Oath, which was conceived unjuſt, that in caſes criminal a party ſhould be forced to diſcover what might be penal to himſelf. The lawfulneſs of which Oath was learnedly canvaſſed with arguments on both ſides.</p>
               <p>Becauſe many did queſtion the Legal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And becauſe moſt of the Queens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil were preſent at the Cenſures, this took off the <hi>odium</hi> from the Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>This year died Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> the Induſtrious compiler of the Acts and Monuments of the Church, and was buried at St. <hi>Giles</hi> near <hi>Cripple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> It is ſaid he foretold the deſtruction of the Invincible (ſo called) Spaniſh <hi>Armado,</hi> in the year 1588. which came ſo to paſs though he ſurvived not to ſee the performance of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. <hi>William Lambert</hi> finiſhed his Hoſpital at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Camd Brit. in Kent.</note> founded and endowed by him for poor people.

                  <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Houſe of Commons preſented to the Lords a petition, complaining how many Pariſhes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the North of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> were deſtitute of Preachers, and no care taken to ſupply them. Sixteen were the particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſix firſt were againſt inſufficient Miniſters. Of all the particulars the Houſe fell moſt fiercely on the debate of pluralities, and Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
               <p>The Arch-biſhop pleads for Non-reſidency in divers caſes. He affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (whatever was pretended to the contrary) that <hi>England</hi> then flouriſhed with able Miniſters, more than ever before, yea had more than all Chriſtendom beſides. The Lord <hi>Grey</hi> rejoyned to this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaying, That <hi>England</hi> had more able Miniſters than all the Churches in Chriſtendom, was onely to be attributed to God, who now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hearts of many to ſee into the truth, and that the Schools were better obſerved. The Lord Treaſurer ſeemed to moderate betwixt them. Matters flying thus high, the Archbiſhop with the reſt of the Clergy Petition the Queen: To the Petition were annexed a Catalogue of thoſe inconveniences to the State preſent, State to come, Cathedral
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53424:134"/> Churches, Univerſities, to her Majeſty, to Religion, in caſe pluralities were taken away. Nothing was effected in relation to this matter, but things left, <hi>in ſtatu quo prius,</hi> at the diſſolution of this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>

               <p>In the year 1588. when there was a Treaty of Peace between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> out cometh their Invincible Navy and Army, perfectly appointed for both Elements, Land and Water, to Sayl and March com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in all Warlike Equipage: but that great Fleet was wonderfully defeated by the Engliſh, and diſſipated by ſtormy Winds: and many of the Spaniards were Barbarouſly butchered by the Iriſh.</p>
               <p>For the happy ſucceſs of this action Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> appointed Prayers and Thanksgivings over all the Churches in <hi>England:</hi> and ſhe with a great Train of the Nobility came into St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, (where the Banners taken from the Enemy were placed in view) and there in moſt humble manner gave thanks to Almighty God the giver of all Victory.

               <p>On <hi>September</hi> 1. 1596. Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was brought before the Queen's Commiſſioners, there to take his Oath, and give in his poſitive anſwer to divers Articles objected againſt him. The Articles were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him in the Conſiſtory of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s before <hi>John Elmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the two Lord Chief Juſtices, Juſtice <hi>Gawdy,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Pucker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> (afterward Lord Keeper) and Attorney General <hi>Popham.</hi> The Commiſſioners aſſured him on their credits, that by the Laws of the Realm he was to take his Oath, and to anſwer as he was required. But Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> pleaded, That he thought he was not bound by the Laws of God ſo to do. Hereupon he was ſent to the Fleet unto the reſt of his Brethren.</p>
               <p>Now the main pillars of the Presbyterian party, being ſome in Priſon, more in Trouble, all in Fear, applied themſelves by their ſecret ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and procured his Letter to the Queen in their behalf. But this Letter prevailed little. But Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> on Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s general promiſe to be quiet, procured his diſmiſſion out of the Star-chamber and priſon wherein he was confined. And hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> became very peaceable.</p>
               <p>Then one <hi>Hacket,</hi> born at <hi>Owndle</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire</hi> undertook to be a diſcoverer of, and Informer againſt Recuſants, a confident Fellow, one that was great with <hi>Wigginton</hi> and that Faction. Always Inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that ſome extraordinary courſe muſt be preſently taken with the obſtructors of the <hi>Genevian</hi> diſcipline. Once he deſperatley took his dagger, and violently ſtruck it into the picture of the Queen. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended alſo Revelations, Immediate Raptures, and Diſcourſes with God, as alſo to Buffetings of Satan, atteſting the truth thereof with moſt direful Oathes and Execrations. He railed alſo againſt Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> with other privy Counſellors, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending himſelf ſent from Heaven to reform Church and State. He gave it out, that the principal Spirit of the Meſſias reſted in him, and had two Attendants. <hi>Edmond Coppinger</hi> (the Queen's Servant, and one of good deſcent) for his Prophet of Mercy. And <hi>Henry Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Gentleman, for his Prophet of Judgment. Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in Cheap-ſide, <hi>That Chriſt was come in</hi> Hacket, <hi>with his fan in his hand, to purge the godly from the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They cried Repent, Repent,</hi> &amp;c. The next day all three were ſent to <hi>Bridewel. Hacket</hi> was arraigned, drawn, hanged, and quartered, continuing even at his death his blaſphemous aſſertions. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſtarved himſelf to death in priſon, <hi>Arthington</hi> made his Recantation in a publick writing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the object of the Queen's mercy.</p>

                  <hi>Warkton</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> by vertue of an Oath tendred him the day before by the Queen's Attorney, and ſolemnly taken by him, was examined by the Examiner for the Star-chamber in <hi>Grays</hi> Inn, from ſix a clock in the morning untill ſeven at night, to anſwer unto thirty three Articles, but could onely effectually depoſe to ſome of them: but by his confeſſion he diſcovereth the meetings of the Brethren, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof, the Claſſes more formally ſetled in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> than any where elſe in <hi>England.</hi> When the news of Mr. <hi>Stone's</hi> anſwer was brought abroad, he was generally cenſured by moſt of his party: So that he found it neceſſary, in his own vindication, to impart the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Confeſſion to ſuch as condemned him, if not for a Traitor, at leaſt for a coward in the cauſe. What ſatisfaction this gave to his party I know not. Certainly the Biſhop till his dying day beheld him as an ingenuous man, carrying his conſcience with the reaſon thereof in his own breaſt. He was permitted peaceably to poſſeſs his Parſonage (being none of the meaneſt) though he continued a ſtiff Non-conformiſt, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quietly enjoying his own opinion. He died an old man at <hi>Warkton, Anno</hi> 1617.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stone's</hi> diſcovery marred for the future all their formal meetings, as Claſſically or Synodically methodized.</p>
               <p>Then began the foundation of an Univerſity in <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> then Archdeacon of <hi>Dublin</hi> (afterwards Archbiſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> and Unckle to <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> late Archbiſhop thereof) took a journey into <hi>England,</hi> and procured the Mortmain from Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> who graciouſly granted it, naming the corporation, <hi>Collegium Sanctae ac Individuae Trinitatis, ex fundatione Reginae</hi> Elizibethae, <hi>juxta</hi> Dublin. The Lord <hi>Burgley</hi> is appointed firſt Chancellor of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> Lord Debuty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> iſſued out his Letters to all the Counties in <hi>Ireland</hi> to advance ſo good a deſign. The Iriſh Papiſts were very bountiful thereunto. The Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Dublin:</hi> Sir <hi>Warham St. Leger,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Shane, Robert D'eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> afterwards Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſecond Chancellor of this Univerſity, were Benefactors to it. King <hi>James</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the revenues of this Colledge <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> endowing it with good Lands in the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter. Adam Loftus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the firſt Maſter of the Colledge. Mr. <hi>Luke Chaloner</hi> received and disburſed the moneys, had the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the Fabrick, which he faithfully procured to be finiſhed. The firſt ſtone in this foundation was laid, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1591. and in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53424:136"/> year 1593. Scholars were firſt admitted: and the firſt of them <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> ſince Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> that mirrour of Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Now began a ſad conteſt betwixt Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> Maſter, and Mr. <hi>Walter Travers,</hi> Lecturer of the Temple. <hi>Hooker</hi> was born in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> bred in <hi>Oxford,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledge: one of a ſolid Judgment, and great Reading. A great defender both by Preaching and Writing of the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet never got (nor cared to get) any eminent dignity therein. Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> was bred up in <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge. Travers</hi> travelling to <hi>Geneva,</hi> contracted familiarity with <hi>Beza,</hi> and other forreign Divines. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned He, and commenced Batchelor of Divinity in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and after that went beyond Sea again, and at <hi>Antwerp</hi> was ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by the Presbytery there, where he continued ſome years and Preached (with Mr. <hi>Cartwright)</hi> unto the Engliſh Factory of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, untill at laſt he came over into <hi>England,</hi> and for ſeven years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether became Lecturer in the Temple (refuſing all preſentative prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to decline ſubſcription) and lived Domeſtick Chaplain in the houſe of the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Cecil,</hi> being Tutor for a time to <hi>Robert,</hi> his Son, afterwards Earl of <hi>Sarisbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea now ſo great grew the credit of Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> that (by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvin)</hi> he and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> were ſolemnly ſent for, to be Divinity-profeſſors in the Univerſity of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> This proffer being joyntly refuſed, <hi>Travers</hi> quietly continued Lecturer in the Temple, till Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> became the Maſter thereof. Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> voice was low, ſtature little, geſture none at all, ſtanding ſtill in the Pulpit. His ſtile was long and pithy, ſo that when the copiouſneſs of his ſtile met not with proportionable capacity in his Auditors, it was unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſured for tedious and obſcure. His Sermons were for the moſt part on Controverſies, and deep points of School-divinity.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> his utterance was graceful, geſture plauſible, matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and method plain. But theſe two Preachers acted with different Principles, and claſhed one againſt another: ſo that what Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Fore-noon, Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> confuted in the After-noon. Here Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> interpoſed his power, and ſilenced <hi>Travers</hi> from Preaching in the Temple or any where elſe; <hi>Travers</hi> Petitions the Lords of the Council: his Petition is publickly extant in Print, with Maſter <hi>Hooker's</hi> anſwer thereunto. But Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> notwithſtanding his friends at Court, was over-born by the Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him over to be Provoſt of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Embracing the motion, he accepted the place, and continued ſome years therein, till for fear of their Civil Wars he returned into <hi>England,</hi> and lived here many years after very obſcurely.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:53424:137"/>
               <p>In the year 1592. In <hi>London</hi> more than ten thouſand died of the Plague, and among them Reverend Mr. <hi>Richard Greenham.</hi> He was one that always bitterly inveighed againſt Non-reſidents, he ended his days at <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal</hi> was indicted, and arraigned at <hi>Croidon,</hi> for defaming the Queen her Government, in a Book by him written and entitled, <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Diſcipline which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word for the Government of his Church in all times and places unto the World's end.</hi> But the mortal words (as they may be termed) are in the Preface of the Book, written, <hi>To the ſuppoſed Governours of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. and are inſerted in the Body of his indictment.</p>
               <p>To this Indictment he pleaded <hi>Not guilty,</hi> denying himſelf to be the Author of the Book. Next day he was caſt by the Jury, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the Marſhalſey; <hi>March</hi> following he was brought again to the bar before the Judges, to whom he had privately preſented a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all advantage, but it found no entertainment, inſomuch that in this moneth of <hi>March,</hi> he at the Aſſizes held in <hi>Southwark,</hi> was there condemned to be executed for a Felon.</p>
               <p>Various were mens Cenſures on theſe proceedings againſt him. The proof was not pregnant (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fuller)</hi> and it is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he made onely the Preface, out of which his indictment was chiefly framed) and not the body of the Book laid to his charge. But without any other ſickneſs, ſave heart-broken with ſorrow, he died peaceably in his bed. The Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> flocked to his Funeral, and he was decently interred in the Church-yard of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi> not far from Biſhop <hi>Bonner's</hi> grave. He was Father to <hi>Ephraim <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dal,</hi> a pious and ſolid Divine, but in point of Diſcipline differing in Opinion from his Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 1593. Henry Barrow</hi> Gentleman, and <hi>John Greemoood</hi> Clerk, were condemned, and executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> for writing certain Seditious Pamphlets. And not long after, <hi>John Penry,</hi> a Welch-man, was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and condemned of Felony, at the King's Bench Bar, for being a principal penner, and publiſher of a Libellous Book, called <hi>Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-prelate,</hi> and executed at St. <hi>Thomas Waterings.</hi>

               <p>The ſame year died <hi>John Piers,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> highly eſteemed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth:,</hi> whoſe Almoner he was many years; and <hi>John El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> He was one of a low ſtature, but ſtout ſpirit, a witty man, a ſtiff-champion of the Church-diſcipline, on which account none was more mocked by <hi>Martin-mar-prelat,</hi> or hated by Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</p>

               <p>Of the Papiſts died, <hi>Anno</hi> 1594. two principal pillars beyond the Seas: firſt <hi>William Roſe,</hi> bred in <hi>Wincheſter-ſchool,</hi> then in <hi>New-colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> He went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there ſolemnly abjured the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion: from <hi>Rome</hi> he removed to <hi>Rhemes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where he became Profeſſor of Divinity and Hebrew in the Engliſh Colledge: He died at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the fiftieth year of his Age, as he was making a Book, called <hi>Calvino-Turciſmus,</hi> which after by his dear friend, <hi>William Gifford,</hi> was finiſhed, ſet forth, and dedicated to <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>William Allen</hi> died alſo the ſame year.

Untill this time the prime Catholicks in <hi>Wisbich</hi> Caſtle, had lived there in reſtraint, with great concord. And the Papiſts do brag, that then and there the Engliſh Church was moſt viſible, untill one Father <hi>Weſton,</hi> a Jeſuite coming thither, erected a Government among them, making certain Sanctions and Orders, which all were bound to obſerve, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſuperiority over all the Catholicks there. Beſides thoſe of his own ſociety, many of the Secular Prieſts ſubmitted unto him, though the greateſt number and Learned ſort of the Secular Prieſts reſiſted his ſuperiority. If any Order might pretend to this Priority, it was moſt proper for the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> extant in <hi>England</hi> above a thouſand years ago: one might admire why Father <hi>Weſton</hi> ſhould ſo earneſtly deſire ſo ſilly a Dominion, having his power, as well as his own perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the walls of <hi>Wisbich</hi> Caſtle.</p>

Hereupon the Lord's day (eſpecially in Corporations) began to be preciſely kept, people forbearing ſuch ſports as yet by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute permitted; yet Learned men were much divided in their Judgments about the Sabbatarian Doctrines. The firſt that publickly oppoſed Dr. <hi>Bounds</hi> Opinions, was Mr. <hi>Thomas Rogers</hi> of <hi>Horninger</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> in his Preface to the Book of Articles: yet notwithſtanding were theſe Sabbatarian Doctrines publiſhed more generally than before.

               <p>At this time the City of <hi>Geneva</hi> was in a low eſtate; for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> addicted to the Spaniſh faction had baniſhed all Proteſtants of his Dominions.

               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the mirrour of her Sex and Age, died having Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over this Kingdom above fourty years. Her Corps were Solemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred under a fair Tomb in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey.</p>
               <p>Now the Defenders both of Epiſcopacy and Presbitery, with equal hopes of ſucceſs, make (beſides private and particular Addreſſes) publick and viſible Applications to King <hi>James,</hi> the firſt to continue, the laſt to ſet up their Government.

               <p>No ſooner was King <hi>James</hi> ſetled on the Engliſh throne, but Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> preſented unto him his Latine Comment on <hi>Eccleſiaſtes:</hi> and died ſoon after. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> Preached his funeral Sermon.</p>
               <p>Now there being a general expectation of a Parliament to ſucceed; the Presbterian party went about to get hands of the Miniſters to a petition which they intended ſeaſonably to preſent to the King and Parliament.

               <list>
                  <item>1. The Matter.</item>
                  <item>2. The Perſons.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, whether it were executed in light Caſes, which cauſeth the undervaluing thereof, For the perſons, he would be reſolved, why Chancellors and Commiſſaries being lay men ſhould do it, and not rather the Biſhops themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for providing Miniſters for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> he ſaid he would refer it in the laſt dayes Conference to a Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſultation.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> anſwered, that Confirmation hath been uſed in the Catholick Church ever ſince the Apoſtles. The Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> That it is an Apoſtolical Inſtitution, named in expreſs words. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. The Biſhop of <hi>Carlile</hi> Learnedly urged the ſame. And the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> urged ſomething out of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> for the Impoſition of hands on Children.</p>
               <p>The Concluſion was this, for the fuller explanation, that we make Confirmation neither a Sacrament, nor a Corroboration thereof, their Lordſhip ſhould conſider whether it might not without alteration, be entitled an <hi>Examination</hi> with a <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Abſolution,</hi> the Archbiſhop told His Majeſty that it is clear from all Superſtition as it is uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as will appear on the Reading both of the Confeſſion and Abſolution following it, in the beginning of the Communion-book.
<q>
                     <p>Here the King peruſed both, liked and approved them.</p>
                     <p>The Particular and Perſonal Abſolution in the Viſitation of the ſick, was alſo Read by the Dean of the Chappel, and approved by the King.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Concluſion was this, That the Biſhops ſhould Conſult, whether unto the Rubrick of the General Abſolution, theſe words <hi>[Remiſſion of ſins]</hi> might not be added for explanation-ſake.</p>
               <p>To the point of <hi>Private Baptiſm,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſaid, the Adminiſtration thereof by women and Lay-perſons is not allowed in the Practice of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The King anſwered, the words of the Book cannot but intend a permiſſion of ſuch perſons to Baptiſe. The Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſaid, that the Compilers of the book did not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53424:141"/> them, as appeareth by their contrary practice. The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſaid, thoſe men intended a permiſſion of private perſons to baptiſe but in caſe of neceſſity. Here he ſpake much of the neceſſity of Baptiſm. The King anſwered, this neceſſity of Baptiſm I ſo underſtand, that it is neceſſary to be had, if lawfully to be had, <hi>i. e.</hi> Miniſtred by lawful Miniſters, by whom alone, and no private perſon in any caſe it may be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>The reſult was this, To conſult, whether in the Rubrick of Private baptiſm, theſe words <hi>[Curate,</hi> or <hi>lawful Miniſter]</hi> may not be inſerted.</p>
               <p>For the point of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> His Majeſty propounded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in cauſes of leſſer moment the name might not be altered, and the ſame cenſure retained. Secondly, whether in place thereof another coertion equivalent thereunto might not be invented. Which all ſides yielded unto, and ſo was an end of the firſt dayes conference.</p>
               <p>On Monday <hi>January</hi> 16. they all met in the ſame place with all the Deans and Doctors aforementioned <hi>(Patrick Galloway</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Perth</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> admitted alſo to be there) and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> ſate on a Stool by his Father. After the King had made a pithy ſpeech to the four oppoſers of conformity. He willed them to begin.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid, All things diſliked, or queſtioned, may be reduced to theſe four heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>That the Doctrine of the Church might be preſerved in purity accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's word.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>That good Paſtors might be planted in all Churches to preach the ſame.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>That the Church-government might be ſincerely Miniſtred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's word.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>That the book of Common-prayer might be fitted to more encreaſe of Piety.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, he deſired, that the book of Articles of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on 1562. might be explained where obſcure, enlarged where defective, <hi>viz.</hi> Art. 16. where it is ſaid, <hi>After we have received the Holy Ghoſt, we may depart from Grace,</hi> Thoſe words may be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with this addition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>yet neither totally nor finally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He propounded alſo, that the nine Aſſertions concluded on at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> might be inſerted into the Book of Articles. Some other things alſo he added.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſpeaks paſſionately againſt Dr. <hi>Rainolds:</hi> for which the King reproveth him.</p>
               <p>As for Private Baptiſm, His Majeſty ſaid, he had already with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops taken order for the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:53424:141"/>
               <p>Then came they to <hi>Confirmation.</hi> And after ſome debate thereon betwixt Dr. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> his Majeſty ſaid, he intended not to take confirmation from the Biſhops which they had ſo long enjoyed; ſeeing as great reaſon that none ſhould confirm, as none ſhould Preach without the Biſhop's Licenſe.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid. It were well, if this propoſition might be added to the book of Articles, <hi>The Intention of the Miniſter is not of the Eſſence of the Sacrament.</hi> He urged again, that the nine Orthodoxal Aſſertions concluded at <hi>Lambeth</hi> may be generally received.</p>
               <p>The King thought it unfit to thruſt into the book of Articles every poſition Negative, which would ſwell the book into too great a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. And as to the nine Aſſertions, his Majeſty ſaid, he knew not what they were. The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> told the King the occaſion of them. He anſwered, the better courſe would be to puniſh the broachers of falſe Doctrine than to multiply Articles.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> requeſted, that one Uniform Catechiſm may be made, and none other generally received.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty thought the Doctor'<hi>s</hi> requeſt very reaſonable, yet ſo, that the Catechiſm may be made in the feweſt, and plaineſt affirmative terms that may be. And herein (ſaid he) I would have two Rules to be obſerved. 1. That curious and deep queſtions be avoided in the fundamental inſtruction of a people. 2. That there ſhould not be ſo general a departure from the Papiſts, that every thing ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an errour wherein we agree with them.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid, Great is the profanation of the Sabbath day, and contempt of your Majeſtie's Proclamation which I earneſtly deſire may be Reformed.</p>
               <p>This motion found an unanimous conſent.</p>
               <p>Then the Doctor deſired that the Bible be New Tranſlated, &amp;c. His Majeſty anſwered, that he never yet ſaw a Bible well-tranſlated in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and he wiſhed ſome ſpecial pains were taken for an Uniform Tranſlation, which ſhould be done by the beſt Learned in both Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities; then reviewed by the Biſhops, preſented to the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, laſtly ratified by Royal Authority to be read in the Church, and none other.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> moved alſo, that unlawful and Seditious Books be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. The Lord <hi>Cecil,</hi> that theſe had done much miſchief, but eſpecially one, called <hi>Speculum Tragicum.</hi> His Majeſty ſaid, that was a dangerous book indeed.</p>
               <p>Concerning the planting of Learned Miniſters in every Pariſh, His Majeſty ſaid he had conſulted with his Biſhops about it; whom he found willing and ready herein.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> moved, that there might be a praying Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry among us, ſaying, that men now thought it is the onely duty of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53424:142"/> Miniſters to ſpend their time in the Pulpit. His Majeſty well liked his motion. His ſecond motion was, that until Learned men may be planted in every Congregation, Godly Homilies may be read therein. The King liked this motion, eſpecially where the living is not ſufficient to maintain a Learned Preacher. Alſo where were multitudes of Sermons, he would have Homilies read divers times. The Plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iffs confeſſed, A Preaching Miniſtry is beſt; but where it may not be had, Godly Prayers and exhortations do much good. The Biſhop's laſt motion was, that Pulpits may not be made paſquils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every diſcontented perſon may traduce his Superiors. His Majeſty approved thereof.</p>
               <p>Then Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> came to <hi>Subſcription,</hi> as a great impeachment to a Learned Miniſtry, and therefore entreated it might not be exacted as heretofore, for which many good men are kept out, though otherwiſe willing to ſubſcribe to the Statutes of the Realm, Articles of Religion, and the King's Supremacy. He objected againſt the enjoyning of the Apocrypha Books to be read in the Church, ſome Chapters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining manifeſt errours repugnant to Scripture.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty ſaid, he would not have all Canonical books read in the Church, nor any Chapter out of the Apocrypha, wherein any errour is contained.</p>
               <p>The next ſcruple againſt Subſcription was, becauſe it was twice ſet down in the Common-prayer-book, <hi>Jeſus ſaid to his Diſciples,</hi> when by the Text in the Original it is plain, that he ſpake to the Phariſees. His Majeſty anſwered, let the word <hi>[Diſciples]</hi> be omitted; and the words <hi>[Jeſus ſaid]</hi> be Printed in a different Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> took exceptions at the Croſs in baptiſm, and ſaid, it is queſtionable whether the Church hath power to inſtitute an outward ſignificant ſign. The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> anſwered, The Croſs in Baptiſm is not uſed otherwiſe than a Ceremony.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty deſired to be acquainted about the Antiquity of the uſe of Croſs. Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid, it hath been uſed ever ſince the Apoſtles time, but the queſtion is, how Ancient the uſe thereof hath been in Baptiſm. The Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſaid, in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time it was uſed in Baptiſm. His Majeſty replied, it ſo, I ſee no reaſon but we may continue it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> ſaid, put caſe the Church may add ſignificant ſigns, it may not add them where Chriſt hath already ordained them; which is as Derogatory to Chriſt's Inſtitution, as if one ſhould add to the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> His Majeſty anſwered, the caſe is not alike, ſeeing the Sacrament is fully finiſhed, before the uſe of the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> demanded then, how far the Ordinance of the Church bindeth without impeaching Chriſtian Liberty? The King anſwered, I will have one Doctrine, one Diſcipline, one Religion in ſubſtance, and in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53424:142"/> Ceremony. Never ſpeak more to that point, how far ye are bound to obey.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> wiſhed, that the Croſs (being Superſtitiouſly abuſed in Popery) were abandoned, as the Brazen-ſerpent was ſtamped to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> becauſe abuſed to Idolatry.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty anſwered, Inaſmuch as the Croſs was abuſed to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in time of Propery, it doth plainly imply, that it was well uſed before. He ſaid, he deteſted their courſes, who peremptorily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow of all things which have been abuſed in Popery, and know not how to anſwer the Objections of the Papiſts, when they charge us with Novelties, but by telling them, we retain the Primitive uſe of things, and onely forſake their Novel corruptions. Secondly, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between the Brazen-Serpent (a material viſible thing) and the ſign of the Croſs made in the Air.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Papiſts did never aſcribe any ſpiritual grace to the Croſs in Baptiſm. Laſtly, material Croſſes to which people fell down in time of Popery (as the Idolatrous Jews to the Brazen-ſerpent) are already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, as you deſire.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> proceeded, excepting at the wearing of the Surplice, a kind of garment (ſaid he) uſed by the Prieſts of <hi>Iſis.</hi> His Majeſty anſwered, he did not think till of late, it had been borrowed from the Heathen, becauſe commonly called <hi>a Rag of Popery.</hi> And ſeeing we border not upon Heathens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſee no reaſon (ſaid he) but for comelineſs ſake it may be continued.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid, I take exception at theſe words in Marriage, <hi>With my body I thee worſhip.</hi> His Majeſty anſwered, I find it an uſual Engliſh Term, A Gentleman of Worſhip: and it agreeth with the Scriptures, <hi>Giving honour to the wife</hi> The Dean of <hi>Sarum</hi> ſaid, ſome take exception at the Ring in Marriage. Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> ſaid, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it well enough. Then ſaid he, ſome take exceptions at <hi>the Churching of women</hi> by the name of <hi>Purification.</hi> His Majeſty ſaid, I allow it very well.</p>
               <p>Unto Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> his laſt exception againſt committing Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cenſures to Lay-chancellors, His Majeſty anſwered, that he had conferred with the Biſhops about that point, and ſuch order ſhould be taken therein as was Convenient.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> deſired, That according to certain Provin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituions the Clergy may have meetings every three weeks. 1. In Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deaneries, therein to have <hi>prophecying,</hi> as Archbiſhop <hi>Grindal,</hi> and other Biſhops, deſired of her late Majeſty. 2. That ſuch things as could not be reſolved on there, might be referred to the Archdeacons Viſitations. 3. And ſo to the Epiſcopal Synod, to determine ſuch points before not decided.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:53424:143"/>
               <p>His Majeſty anſwered. If you aim at a Scottiſh Presbytery, it agreeth as well with Monarchy, as God and the Devil. Then <hi>Jack</hi> and <hi>Tom,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall meet, and cenſure me and my Council.</p>
               <p>Then the King asked the Doctor, whether they had any thing elſe to ſay?</p>
               <p>He anſwered, No more, if it pleaſe your Majeſty.</p>
               <p>If this be all your party have to ſay, ſaid the King, I will make them conform, or elſe I will harry them out of the Land, or do worſe.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the ſecond dayes Conference.</p>
               <p>The third began on the Wedneſday following, many Knights, Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Doctors of the Law, being admitted thereunto, becauſe the <hi>High-commiſſion</hi> was the principal matter in debate.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty thus began I underſtand, that the parties named in the High-commiſſion are too many, and too mean, and the matters they deal with, baſe, ſuch as Ordinaries might cenſure in their Courts at home.</p>
               <p>Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.]</hi> Were not their number many, I ſhould oftentimes ſit alone. I have often complained of the meanneſs of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters handled therein, but cannot remedy it: for though the offence be ſmall, that the Ordinary may, yet the Offender oft-times is ſo great, that the Ordinary is forced to crave help at the High-commiſſion to puniſh him</p>
               <p>A nameleſs Lord ſaid, The proceedings in that Court are like the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inquiſition, wherein men are urged to ſubſcribe more than Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; and by the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> forced to accuſe themſelves, being examined upon many Articles on a ſudden, and for the moſt part againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor ſaid, There is neceſſity, and uſe of the Oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> in divers Courts and Cauſes.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty ſaid, That it is requiſite that fame and ſcandals be looked unto in Courts Eccleſiaſtical, and yet great moderation is to be uſed therein. And here he ſoundly deſeribed the Oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> for the ground thereof, the wiſdom of the Law therein, the manner of proceeding thereby, and profitable effect from the ſame.</p>
               <p>After much diſcourſe between the King, the Biſhops, and the Lords, about the quality of the Perſons, and Cauſes, in the High Commiſſion, rectifying Excommunications in matters of leſs moment, puniſhing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, providing Divines for <hi>Ireland, Wales,</hi> and the Northern bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the four Preachers were called in, and ſuch alterations in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were read unto them, which the Biſhops, by the King's advice, had made, unto which, by their ſilence, they ſeemed to conſent.</p>
               <p>Then the King ſaid to Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> and his Aſſociates, <hi>I expect obedience and humility from you (the marks of honeſt and good men) and that you would perſwade others abroad by your example.</hi>

                  </gap> Conference. Doctor <hi>Sparks</hi> ſoon after ſet forth a Treatiſe of Unity and Uniformity.</p>
               <p>This Conference produced ſome alterations in the Liturgy; Womens baptiſing formerly frequent, hereafter forbidden; in the Rubrick of Abſolution, Remiſſion of ſins inſerted, Confirmation termed alſo an Examination of Children, and ſome words altered in the Dominical Goſpels, with a reſolution for a new tranſlation of the Bible. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward many, that wavered before, for the future quietly digeſted the Ceremonies of the Church.</p>
               <p>About this time a Petition, called the Millenary Petition for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ſolemnly preſented to his Majeſty, in the name of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> deſiring Reformation of certain Ceremonies and abuſes of the Church. Subſcribed, <hi>Your Majeſties moſt humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, that deſire not a diſorderly Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a due and godly Reformation.</hi> The Epiſcopal party gave this Petition a laſh, ſome with their Pens, more with their Tongues. The Univerſities were juſtly netled thereat. <hi>Cambridge</hi> paſſed a Grace in their Congregation, That <hi>whoſoever, in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, ſhould by word, or writing, oppoſe the received Doctrine, and Diſcipline, of</hi> England, <hi>or any part thereof, ſhould be ſuſpended from their former, and excluded from all future Degrees. Oxford</hi> followed, making a ſharp and ſtrong confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Petition. After his Majeſty had diſcountenanced it, ſome of the oppoſite party maintained, That now the property thereof was altered, from a Petition to a Libel.</p>
               <p>Soon after died Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift</hi> of the Palſey, and was buried at <hi>Croidon,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> his Pupils attending his Herſe; and Biſhop <hi>Babington</hi> (his Pupil alſo) made his Funeral Sermon. <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> brought up in <hi>Jeſus-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> ſucceeded him in the Archbiſhoprick.</p>
               <p>Now a Parliament was aſſembled, in which it was enacted, <hi>That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King himſelf, nor his Succeſſors, ſhould be capable of any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be conveyed unto them, otherwiſe than for three lives, or twenty one years.</hi> Thus the King was pleaſed to bind himſelf for the liberty of the Church: and hereby he eaſed himſelf of many troubleſome Suitors.</p>
               <p>In the Convocation many Canons were made. A Book of Canons was compiled, not only being the ſum of the late Queens Articles, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of her Commiſſioners, Canons of 1571. and 1597. which were in uſe before, but alſo many more were added, the whole number amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto 141 An explanation was made in one of the Canons of the uſe of the Croſs in Baptiſm. Biſhop <hi>Rudd,</hi> of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> oppoſed the Oath of Simony.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1564. the Family of Love preſented a tedious Petition to King <hi>James,</hi> wherein, by fawning expreſſions, they ſeek to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his Majeſties good opinion.

               <p>The principal Contriver of this Plot was <hi>Robert Catesby,</hi> a Gentleman of good account in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> who drew in many other Papiſts to aſſiſt him. <hi>Gerard</hi> tyeth them together with an Oath of ſecrecy. <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Tiſmond</hi> encourage the deſign. But here an important ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was injected, how to part their Friends from their Foes in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Here <hi>Garnet,</hi> inſtead of untying, cut this knot aſunder. That in ſuch a caſe as this it was lawful to kill Friend and Foe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now though theſe Plotters intended at laſt, with honour, to own the Action, when ſucceſs had ſecured all things; yet they purpoſed, when the blow was firſt given, to father the fact upon thoſe that were called Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans. But for the diſcovery of this Plot, God's Providence ſo ordered it, that a Letter was framed, and ſent to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle,</hi> brought him by one of his Footmen, which he received from an unknown man in the ſtreet, in manner following</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, out of the love I bear to ſome of your Friends, I have a care of your preſervation. Therefore, I would adviſe you, as you tender your life, to forbear your attendance at this Parliament: for God, and man,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53424:144"/> have concurred to puniſh the wickedneſs of this time. And think not ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this advertiſement, but retire your ſelf into your Countrey, where you may expect the event in ſafety: for, though there be no appearance of any ſtir, yet, I ſay, they ſhall receive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they ſhall not ſee who hurts them, This counſel is not to be contemned, becauſe it may do you good, and can do you no harm, for the danger is paſt as ſoon as you have burnt the Letter. And, I hope, God will give you the grace to make uſe of it, to whoſe holy protection I commend you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Mounteag'e</hi> communicates the Letter to the Earl of <hi>Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> He to the King, who on the ſecond peruſal expounded the myſtical blow meant therein, muſt be by Gunpowder, and gives order for ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rooms under the Parliament Houſe. The firſt ſearch, about evening, diſcovered nothing but <hi>Percie</hi>'s Cellar full of Wood, and <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> his man (under that name was <hi>Faux</hi> diſguiſed) attending therein. At midnight a more ſtrict and ſecret ſearch was made by Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>

                  <hi>Knevet,</hi> Gentleman of his Majeſty's Privy Chamber, and others, in the Vault under the Parliament Houſe. There was quickly diſcovered, a pile of fewel, faced over with Billets, lined under with thirty ſix Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder, beſides Iron bars to make the force of the ſire more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. <hi>Guido Faux</hi> was apprehended in the outward room, with a dark Lanthorn in his hand, and three Matches ready to give fire to the Train. Mean-time <hi>Catesby, Percy, Rookwood,</hi> both the <hi>Wrights,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> were hovering about <hi>London,</hi> to attend the iſſue of the matter. They, and their Servants, poſt down into the Countrey, through <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-ſhire, Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> into <hi>Stafford-ſhire;</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Verney,</hi> High Sheriff of <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> chaſed them from thence, and Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Walſh,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> overtook them at <hi>Holbeck</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Stephen Littleton,</hi> where, upon their reſiſtance, the two <hi>Wrights</hi> were killed, <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> grievouſly wounded. <hi>Percy,</hi> and <hi>Catesby,</hi> ſetting back to back, fought deſperately againſt all that aſſaulted them; after many Swords drawn upon them, they were both ſlain with one ſhot of a Muſquet. <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> was taken about the Court, and ſent to the Tower, where he confeſſed all, and within a few dayes after died of the Strangury.</p>
               <p>The reſt were ſolemnly arraigned, convicted, condemned at <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>The next day <hi>Thomas Winter, Ambroſe Rookwood, Keys,</hi> and <hi>Faux,</hi> were executed, as the former, in the Parliament-yard in <hi>Weſtminſter. Keys</hi> followed <hi>Grant</hi> in his obſtinacy: and <hi>Faux</hi> ſhewed more penitency than all the reſt.</p>

At his death he confeſſed his fault, asked forgiveneſs, and exhorted all Catholicks never to plot any Treaſon againſt King or State, as a courſe which God would never proſper.</p>

               <p>The Parliament enacted many things for the diſcovering and repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Popiſh Recuſants. Whereof none was more effectual, than that Oath of Allegiance, which every Catholick was commanded to take. The Pope hereupon diſpatched two <hi>Breves</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> prohibiting all Catholicks to take this Oath, ſo deſtructive to their own ſouls, and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> exhorting them to ſuffer perſecution, and manfully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Martyrdom. Notwithſtanding all which, this Oath being tendred to, was generally taken by Catholicks, without any ſcruple. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>George Blackwell,</hi> Archprieſt of the Engliſh, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and caſt into priſon, by taking this Oath wrought his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement. This Oath was miniſtred immediately after the putting forth of a Proclamation, which commanded all Seminaries and Jeſuits to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Land.</p>
               <p>Now the Alarm being given, whether this Oath was lawful or no, both parties, of Proteſtants and Papiſts, wrote againſt each other. King <hi>James</hi> wrote an Apology for the Oath of Allegiance, together with a Premonition to all moſt mighty Monarchs, Kings, free Princes, and States of Chriſtendom, effectually confuting the Pope's <hi>Breves.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Barlow</hi> againſt <hi>Parſons,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> Doctor <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> Doctor <hi>Collins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Burrel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tomſon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Peter Du-moulin,</hi> maintain the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of the Oath againſt <hi>Suarez, Eudaemon, Becanus, Coftetus, Pele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius,</hi> and others.</p>

So great was his Memory, that he could readily turn to all material paſſages in every Leaf, Page, Volume, Paragraph, in all his voluminous Books. A man of a ſolid Judgment, and great Humility. His diſaffection to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Diſcipline was not ſo great, as ſome Biſhops did ſuſpect, or as more Non-conformiſts did believe. He deſired the aboliſhing of ſome Ceremonies for the eaſe of others Conſciences, to which, in his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, he did willingly ſubmit, kneeling at the Sacrament, and conſtantly wearing Hood and Surplice. On his death-bed he deſired <hi>Abſolution,</hi> according to the form of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and received it from Doctor <hi>Holland.</hi> Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> made his Funeral Oration in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Sir <hi>Iſaac Wake</hi> in the Univerſity.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53424:147"/> and was buried at <hi>Haunes</hi> in <hi>Bedford-ſhire,</hi> whereof he had been Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter fifteen years, Doctor <hi>Bulkley</hi> preaching his Funeral Sermon.</p>

               <p>This year King <hi>James</hi> was careful for the ſeaſonable ſuppreſſion of the dangerous Doctrines of <hi>Conradus Vorſtius.</hi> This Doctor had lived about fifteen years a Miniſter at <hi>Steinford,</hi> within the Territories of the Counts of <hi>TECLENB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RG, BENTHAM,</hi> &amp;c. the Counts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were the firſt in caſting off the Romiſh yoke, and ever ſince continuing Proteſtants. This <hi>Vorſtius</hi> had written to, and received Letters from certain <hi>San oſatenian</hi> Hereticks in <hi>Poland</hi> and became infected therewith. Hereupon he ſet ſorth two Books; the one entitled, <hi>TRACTAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53424:148"/> THEOLOGIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S DE DEO,</hi> dedicated to the Land-grave of <hi>HES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEN:</hi> the other <hi>EXEGESIS APOLOGETICA,</hi> dedicated to the States, both of them ſtuffed with many dangerous Poſitions concerning the Deity.</p>
               <p>This Wretch debaſed the Purity of God, aſſigning him a material body, confining his Immenſity, as not being every where, ſhaking his Immutability, as if his Will were ſubject to change; darkening his Omniſciency, as uncertain in future contingents, with many more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Opinions. Notwithſtanding all this, the ſaid <hi>Vorſtius</hi> was choſen by the Curators of the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to be their publick Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Profeſſor, in the place of <hi>Arminius</hi> lately deceaſed; and to that end the States General, by their Letters ſent, and ſued to the Count of <hi>TECKLENBO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RGH</hi> and obtained of him, that <hi>Vorſtius</hi> ſhould come from <hi>Steinford,</hi> and become publick Profeſſor in <hi>Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> being this Aucumn in his hunting Progreſs, did light upon, and peruſed the aforeſaid Books of <hi>Vorſtius;</hi> he obſerved the dangerous Poſitions therein, determining ſpeedily to oppoſe them. Hereupon he preſently diſpatched a Letter to Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood,</hi> his Ambaſſador, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lident with the States, requiring him to let them underſtand, how highly he ſhould be diſpleaſed, if ſuch a Monſter as <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> ſhould be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their Church. This was ſeconded with a large Letter of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties to the States, dated <hi>October</hi> the ſixth, to the ſame effect. But the States entertain not the motion of King <hi>James</hi> againſt <hi>Vorstius,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to expectation. They ſaid, <hi>That if</hi> Vorſtius <hi>had formerly been faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in offenſive expreſſions, he had ſince cleared himſelf in a n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> therefore gave Inſtructions to his Ambaſſador, to make publick proteſtation againſt their proceedings, which Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> moſt ſolemnly performed. And after his Majeſties Requeſt, Letter, and Proteſtation, had miſſed their deſired effect, he wrote in French a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration againſt <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> which ſince, by his leave, hath been tranſlated into Engliſh, among his other Works. <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his Books were alſo, by the King's Command, publickly burnt at St. <hi>Paul's-croſs</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and in both Univerſities.</p>
               <p>The ſame year, in <hi>March, Bartholomew Legate,</hi> an <hi>Arrian,</hi> was burnt in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for denying the Deity of the Son of God, and holding, that there are no Perſons in the Godhead, with many other damnable Tenets.</p>
               <p>In the next month <hi>Eaward Wightman,</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> was burnt at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> for holding ten ſeveral Hereſies, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Cerinthus, Valentinian, Arrius, Macedonius, Simon Magus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Manicheus, Photinus,</hi> and of the Anabaptiſts.

               <p>Then was there a conference entertained between Dr. <hi>White,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> Proteſtants; Father <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and Father <hi>White,</hi> Jeſuites: Now hapned the fatal Veſpers at <hi>Black-friers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Father <hi>Drury</hi> a Jeſuite, of excellent Morals, Preached there in a great upper-room, next to the Houſe of the French Ambaſſador, where three hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were aſſembled.

About the middle of his Sermon, and the day declining, on a ſudden the Floor fell down where they were aſſembled; many were killed, more bruiſed, all fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>King <hi>James,</hi> after he had been troubled with a Tertian Fever four weeks at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> called unto him his onely Son, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> to whom he recommended the protection of the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> and died on the ſeven and twentieth day of <hi>March.</hi> He Reigned twenty two years and three days.</p>
               <p>The ſad news of King <hi>James</hi> his death was brought to <hi>White-hall,</hi> when Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, was Preaching therein. This cauſed him to break off his Sermon in the midſt thereof, out of civil compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

Queen <hi>Mary</hi> landed at <hi>Dover:</hi> Next day the King coming from <hi>Canterbury,</hi> met her at <hi>Dover,</hi> Thence his Majeſty conducted the Queen to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the ſame Evening the Marriage was there conſummated. On <hi>June</hi> 16. the King and Queen came both to <hi>London.</hi> A Chappel at <hi>Sommerſet-houſe</hi> was built for the Queen and her Family, with conveniences thereto adjoyning for <hi>Capuchin</hi> Friers, who were therein placed; and had permiſſion to walk abroad in their Religious habits.</p>
               <p>Then began a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> wherein the firſt Statute agreed upon was for the more ſtrict obſervation of the Lord's day. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> went to the Houſe of Peers with a meſſage from the Commons, deſiring their concurrence in a petition concerning Religion, and againſt Recuſants, which being agreed to, and preſented to the King, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty anſwered, <hi>That he was glad, that the Parliament was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53424:156"/> in matters of Religion, and aſſured them, they ſhould find him as forward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> was brought to the Bar of the Commons Houſe, for his Book fore-mentioned, which was Printed, and dedicated to King <hi>Charles.</hi> But the King reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ued him from the Houſe of Commons, by taking Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s buſineſs into his own hand. The Plague increaſing in <hi>London,</hi> the Parliament removed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Chalenor</hi> died of that infection. The Parliament to prevent the growth of Popery, preſented a petition to his Majeſty, containing ſixteen particulars, to which they received a ſatisfactory anſwer from the King.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mountagues</hi> cauſe was recommended to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the Biſhops of <hi>Rocheſter, Oxford,</hi> and St. <hi>Davids,</hi> as the cauſe of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They affirm boldly, that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what uſe there can be of Civil Government in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or of external Miniſtry in the Church, if ſuch fatal Opinions as ſome are, which are oppoſite to thoſe of Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught and maintained. But other Learned men were of a different judgement.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Oxford</hi> in a late Divinity diſputation held upon this Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Regenerate man may fall away totally and finally from Grace?</hi> The Opponent u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ging the Appeal to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Doctor of the Chair handled the Appellator very roughly, ſaying, <hi>That he was a man that ſtudied phraſes more than matter; That he underſtood neither Articles nor Homilies, or at least perverted both; That he attributed, he knew not what vertue to the ſign of the Croſs;</hi> and concluded with an Admonition to the Juniors, <hi>That they ſhould be wary of reading that and the like Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King according to his late anſwer to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> iſſued out a Commiſſion to the Judges, to ſee the Law againſt Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants put in Execution. This was read in all the Courts of Judicature at <hi>Reading</hi> (where <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term was kept) and a letter directed to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to take ſpecial care for the diſcovery of Jeſuites, Seminary Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within his Province.</p>
               <p>In this and the next year many Books from perſons of ſeveral abilities and profeſſions, were written againſt Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Sutcliff</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter;</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Burton;</hi> Mr. <hi>Yates,</hi> a Miniſter of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> his Book he entitled, <hi>Ad Caeſarem ibis.</hi> Dr. <hi>Carleton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter; Anthony Wotton,</hi> Divinity-profeſſor in <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge, and Mr. <hi>Francis Rowſe,</hi> a Lay-man. His Majeſty ſenſible of his Subjects great diſtaſt at Mr. <hi>Mountague's</hi> Book, reſolved to leave him to ſtand or fall according to the juſtneſs of his Cauſe. The Duke imparted as much to the Biſhop of St. <hi>David's,</hi> who conceived it of ſuch ominous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that he entred the ſame in his Diary, <hi>viz. I ſeem to ſee a
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53424:156"/> cloud ariſing, and threatning the Church of</hi> England, <hi>God for his mercy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King iſſued forth a Proclamation, <hi>Whereby he commanded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, within limited time, of all ſuch Children of Noble-men, and other his natural Subjects, who were now breeding up in Schools and Seminaries, and other Houſes of the Popiſh Religion beyond the Seas. That their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Tutors, and Governors, take preſent order to recal them home, and to provide, that they return by the day prefixt, at the utmoſt ſeverity of his Majeſtie's Juſtice. He commanded further, That no Biſhop, Priest, or any other perſon, having taken Orders under any Authority, derived from the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>do preſume to confer Eccleſiaſtical Orders, or exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Function, or Juriſdiction toward any of his Natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in any of his Dominions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Candlemas-day</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> was Crowned, Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> had the chief hand in compiling the form of the Coronation, and had the honour to perform this Solemnity, inſtead of the late Lord Keeper <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> who (through the King's di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Coronation Oath was tendred to the King by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> The Ceremonies of the Coronation being ended, the <hi>Regalia</hi> were offered at the Altar by Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> in the King's Name, and then repoſited.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> fallen into diſgrace, by the diſpleaſure of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> beſought his Majeſty, That he would mitigate the Duke's cauſeleſs anger towards him; and that in his abſence in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, no uſe might be made of his Majeſtie's ſacred Name to wound the Reputation of a poor Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday, February</hi> the ſixth, began the ſecond Parliament of the King's Reign. The Houſe of Commons began where they left at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> with matters of Religion and publick grievances. They made ſtrict enquiry into what abuſes had been of the King's grace, ſince that time, and who were the Authors and Abbettors thereof; for they had been informed of many Pardons and Reprieves to Prieſts and Jeſuites.

               <p>A Committee was named concerning Religion, and the Growth of Popery, and Mr. <hi>Mountague's [Appeal to</hi> Caeſar] was again brought in queſtion, This Book the Commons referred to the Committee for Religion, the contents whereof were reported from Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> to the Houſe, and the Houſe paſſed their Votes thereupon; <hi>That Mr.</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague

               <p>Many reſorting to hear Maſs at <hi>Durham</hi> houſe, in the Lodgings of a Forreign Ambaſſador, the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> was required to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſuch of the King's Subjects as ſhould be preſent at the Maſs, and to commit them to priſon. There was alſo a Letter ſent from the Attorney General, to the Judges of the circuits, to direct their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt Recuſants.</p>

But theſe conferences rather increaſed the differences, than aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</p>
               <p>An old Hall in <hi>Oxford,</hi> formerly called <hi>Broad-gates-Hall,</hi> was this year turned into a new Colledge, and called <hi>Pembrook</hi> Colledge, partly in reſpect to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> then Chancellor of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. This Colledge conſiſteth of a Maſter, ten Fellows, and ten Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, with other Students and Officers to the number of one hundred ſixty nine.</p>
               <p>Now Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> decline's in the Duke's favour, and the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to the oppoſit Intereſt.

A Letter alſo was directed to Sir <hi>George Paul,</hi> a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace in <hi>Surrey,</hi> to pray him to take care in expediting that ſervice. Upon ſearch four ſeveral Prieſts were found in the <hi>Clink, viz. Preſton, Candon, Warrington, Prator. Preſton</hi> was committed to the

He kept there by himſelf apart from the Keeper of the priſon, and had for his lodging part of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter's</hi> houſe, into which there was a paſſage made through the priſon-yard. There were found in his Chamber five or ſix Cart-loads of Books ſet up with ſhelves, as in a Library, or Book-ſeller's ſhop, ſuppoſed to be worth two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds at leaſt: beſides which it was affirmed by the Keeper of the priſon, that he had a greater Library abroad. There were alſo found two Altars ready furniſhed for Maſs; one more publick in an upper Chamber, the other more private, in a Study, many rich Copes, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Wax-candles, Croſſes, Crucifixes very rich, Beads, Jewels, Chaines, Chalices of Silver and of Gold; five or ſix bags of money which were not opened, and looſe money to the quantity of an hundred pound thrown up and down in his Desk; abundance of Manuſcripts, and a pacquet of Letters bound up together with a thread.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Candon's</hi> Chamber was found an Altar ready furniſhed with many Plates, Jewels, rich Pictures and Manuſcripts, Wax-candles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many Books in a Study. In another Study of his many curious Tools and Engines, three Rapiers, one Piſtol, and a Fowling piece, the pictures of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>Charles.</hi> He had alſo in his cuſtody all the Keeper's Warrants for committing of his priſoners, which were found in his Chamber, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome ſtore of Plate, which he ſaid he kept for the Keeper's wife.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Warrington's</hi> Chamber were found Books, Beads, Boxes of Oyl for extreme Unction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the wall thereof was broken down into another houſe adjoyning to the Priſon, through which it is conceived the reſt of <hi>Warrington's</hi> ſtuffe was convaied away in the Interim of the ſearch made in the two former Chambers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prator</hi> was firſt committed to <hi>Gloceſter</hi> Gaol, but a Warrant was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the Papiſts for his remove to the <hi>Clink,</hi> where he was found a priſoner. But a countermand was brought from the Archbiſhop, and Mr. Atturney, whereby the proceeding of that buſineſs was ſtaid, and the Marſhal prohibited to remove, or take any thing, ſo much as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The Keeper and his Wife, and the Prieſts did grievouſly threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Marſhall and all his Aſſiſtants, with very high terms, eſpecially with Arreſts and Impriſonments for this action.</p>
               <p>The Marſhall alſo informed the Committee, that upon the twenty ſecond of <hi>March</hi> laſt, by a like Warrant from the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> he ſearched the Biſhop's priſon, called the <hi>New priſon</hi> in <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons agreed upon a petition to his Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Recuſants, That he would give order to remove from all places of Authority and Government, all ſuch perſons, as are either Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, or juſtly to be ſuſpected. Here they named many Lords, Knights, and Eſquires, in divers Counties of <hi>England.</hi> But this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſoon after diſſolved.</p>
               <p>A general Faſt was obſerved, <hi>July</hi> 5. in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and places adjacent, and on the ſecond of <hi>August,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, to implore a bleſſing upon the endeavours of the State, and the diverting of thoſe judgments which the ſins of the Land deſerved and threatned.</p>
               <p>Divers Lords of the Council were appointed to repair into their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, for the advancement of a Loan to the King. This buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs occaſioned a complaint to the Lords of the Council againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> for publickly ſpeaking words concerning it, which was conceived to be againſt the King and Government. Whereupon Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> informed the Council to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That many were grieved to ſee the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> give place to unconformable Miniſters, when he turned his back to thoſe that were conformable, and how the Puritans ruled all with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations given againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> being tranſmitted to the Council-Table, were ordered to be ſealed up, and committed to the cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Trumbal,</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council: nevertheleſs the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> got a copy of them.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi> publiſhed a Sermon in Print, Preached by him at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton, February</hi> 22. 1626. at Lent Aſſizes, entitled, <hi>Apoſtolick Obedience.</hi> This Book was Licenſed by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved thereof. It was dedicated to the King; it was brought forth upon his Majeſties Commiſſion for raiſing of moneys by way of Loan.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Roger Manwaring</hi> promoted the ſame buſineſs in two Sermons Preached before the King and Court at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The Papiſts at this time were very liberal on this occaſion, that it was then ſaid, That in the point of Allegiance then in hand, the Papiſts were exceeding Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and the Puritans were the onely Recuſants.</p>
               <p>1627.

The occaſion of this Commiſſion was not diſcovered otherwiſe than by what was expreſſed in the Commiſſion it ſelf, <hi>viz. That the ſaid Archbiſhop could not at that preſent in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attend thoſe ſervices, which were otherwiſe proper for his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and juriſdiction; and which as Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>he might and ought in his own Perſon have performed and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop for a memorial of theſe proceedings left to poſterity a Narrative penned with his own hand. The City of <hi>London</hi> was filled with the report of his Confining, and divers men ſpake diverſly of it.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> proffer to pay five thouſand men, if they might but enjoy a toleration. But that motion was cruſhed by Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi>'s Sermon in <hi>Dublin,</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74.</p>
               <p>After this, the King being reſolved upon the calling of a Parliament, Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the cloud they are under, are had in conſideration by the King and Council, and Writs are Ordered to be ſent unto them to ſit in the Houſe as Peers in the enſuing Parliament.</p>
               <p>A little before the Parliament aſſembled, a Society of Recuſants was taken in <hi>Clarkenwel.</hi> Divers of them were found to be Jeſuites, and the houſe wherein they were taken was deſigned to be a Colledge of that <note place="margin">

Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> kept his Metropolitical Viſitation, and hence-forward Conformity was more vigorouſly preſſed than before; Now many differences about Divine Worſhip began to ariſe, and many Books were written <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> One controverſie was about the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Churches. Another about Adoration towards the Altar. A Controverſie was alſo ſtarted about the poſture of the Lord's Boord, Communion-table, or Altar. This laſt controverſie was proſecuted with much needleſs animoſity. Indeed if moderate men had <hi>had</hi> the managing of theſe matters, the accommodation had been eaſie.</p>
               <p>In <hi>June Anno</hi> 1636. Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> were ſentenced in the High-commiſſion-court. Some three years ſince Mr. <hi>Pyrnne</hi> ſet forth a Book, called <hi>Hiſtrio-maſtrix,</hi> for which he was cenſured to loſe his ears on the Pillory, and for a long-time (after two removals to the fleet) Impriſoned in the Tower: whence he diſperſed New Pamphlets, againſt the eſtabliſhed Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for which he was indited in the Star-chamber.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>John Baſtwick</hi> ſet forth a Book, Entitled <hi>Flagellum Pontificis, &amp; Epiſcoporum latialium,</hi> in a fluent Latine Style. He was accuſed in the High-commiſſion, committed to the Gate-houſe, where he wrote a ſecond Book, taxing the injuſtice of the proceedings of the High-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for which he was indited in the Star-chamber.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> Preached a Sermon on the laſt fifth of <hi>November.</hi> On <hi>Prov. 24. 21. My ſon, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are ſubject to change.</hi> This Sermon was afterwards Printed, charging the Prelats for Introducing ſeveral Innovations in Divine Worſhip, for which as a Libel, he was indited in the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber. Mr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ynne</hi>'s Plea is rejected, and his anſwer refuſed; ſo is Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi>'s: and Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s is caſt out for imperfect. The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Court was, that they ſhould loſe their ears in the Palace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53424:161"/> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> fining them alſo five thouſand pounds a man to his Majeſty, and perpetual Impriſonment in three remote places. The Lord <hi>Finch</hi> added to Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s Cenſure, that he ſhould be branded in each Cheek with <hi>S. L.</hi> for a ſlanderous Libeller, to which the whole Court agreed. Two days after, three Pillories were ſet up in Palace-yard; or one double one, and a ſingle one at ſome diſtance, for Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> as the chief offender. Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> firſt ſuffered, making a long ſpeech in the Pillory, not entire; but interrupted with occaſional expreſſions; His ears were cut ſo cloſe, that the <hi>Head-artery</hi> being cut, the blood abundantly ſtreamed down upon the Scaffold, at which he did not ſhrink at all</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> ſucceeded him. His friends highly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commended the erection of his mind over pain and ſhame. Others conceived, that anger in him acted the part of patience, as to the ſtout undergoing of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>The Cenſure was with all rigour executed on Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> commended more for his kindly patience than either of his Predeceſſors in that place. Not long after they were removed, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to <hi>Carnarvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> the one to <hi>Lancaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle;</hi> the other to <hi>Lanceſton</hi> in <hi>Cornwal.</hi> The two latter again were removed, one to the Iſle of <hi>Scilly;</hi> the other to the Iſle of <hi>Gernezey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to <hi>Mount-orguile-caſtle</hi> in <hi>Jerſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next came the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to be Cenſured in the Star-chamber. <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> cenſured.</note> After the great Seal ſome ten years ſince taken from him, he retired himſelf to <hi>Bugden</hi> in <hi>Huntington-ſhire,</hi> where he lived very hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and had great concourſe. Among others, Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> Dean of the Arches, formerly a favourite of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (fetcht off from being proſecuted in Parliament, and Knighted by his means) with Dr. <hi>Sibthorp, Allen</hi> and <hi>Burden,</hi> two Proctors, came to viſit him: and being at dinner with him there was much diſcourſe about Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts. The Biſhop knowing theſe to be buſie men in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch, adviſed them to take off their heavy hand from them, informing them, that the King intended to uſe them hereafter with more mildneſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> adding that He had communicated this unto him by his own mouth.</p>
               <p>A few years after Sir <hi>John Lamb</hi> upon ſome difference with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, informed againſt him for revealing the King's ſecrets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Information was put in againſt him in the Star-chamber, unto which Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> by good advice of Counſel did plead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre, as containing no matter fit for the Cogniſance of that Court, as concerning word; ſpoken of matters done in Parliament, and ſecrets pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be revealed by him, a Privy-counſellour, and Peer of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore not to be heard but in that high Court. The Demurrer being rendred uſeleſs in the Biſhop's Defence, he put in a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53424:162"/> ſtrong plea, which likewiſe being argued and debated in open Court, came at laſt to the ſame fate with the demurrer, as referred to Judge <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and ſmothered by him in a Chamber.</p>
               <p>This plea thus over-ruled, the Biſhop put in a ſpecial anſwer to the Information, declaring, how all was grounded by a Combination of the perſons named in the Bill, out of an intent to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this ſpecial anſwer, Attourney <hi>Noy</hi> rejoyned in iſſue, admitting the Biſhop to prove his ſpecial matters by his Witneſſes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while, the Attorney being ſomewhat remiſs in the proſecution, one <hi>Richard Kilvert,</hi> became the Biſhop's Proſecutor, who had found out, that one <hi>John Prigion,</hi> a Regiſter of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> was a moſt material Witneſs in the Biſhop's defence, the credit of whoſe teſtimony he deſired to invalidate, by charging him with getting a Baſtard on one <hi>Elizabeth Hodſon.</hi> This Baſtard was by the Seſſions at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> ordered to be kept by <hi>Prigion,</hi> as the reputed Father thereof, but at a Seſſions following, the order was reverſed, and the Child fathered on one <hi>Bourn,</hi> and <hi>Prigion</hi> acquitted; and at a third Seſſions it is returned upon <hi>Prigion</hi> again. This laſt Order of Seſſions was again diſſolved as illegal, by the Judges of the King's Bench, and <hi>Prigion</hi> cleared from the Child charged on him: in the doing whereof it was ſaid, that <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> two Agents of the Biſhops, did menace, and tamper, with the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Hence-forward <hi>Kilvert</hi> let fall his firſt information in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> and employed all his power on the proof of <hi>Subornation,</hi> and therein he ſucceeded. The Biſhop was fined eight thouſand pounds, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand marks to Sir <hi>John Munſon,</hi> with <hi>Suſpenſion ab Officio, &amp; Beneficio,</hi> and to be impriſoned during ihe King's pleaſure. All his Preferments in the Church were ſequeſtred to the uſe of the King; and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as Archbiſhop of the Province, exerciſed all kind of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction throughout the Dioceſs of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> not only as an Ordinary of that Dioceſs, but as Viſitor of all thoſe Colledges, which had any dependance on that See. At the ſame time were fined, with the Biſhop, <hi>George Walker,</hi> his Secretary, <hi>Cadwallader Powel,</hi> his Steward, at three hundred pounds a piece, and <hi>Thomas Lund,</hi> the Biſhop's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, at a thouſand marks, all as Defendants in the ſame Cauſe; yet none of them was impriſoned, ſave <hi>Lund</hi> for a few weeks, and their fine never called upon to this day.</p>
               <p>About four years after, <hi>viz.</hi> 1640. when this Biſhop was fetcht out of the Tower, and reſtored a Peer in Parliament he therein preſented ſeveral grievances, concerning the proſecution of this Cauſe againſt him. And the Parliament ordered all the Records of that Suit in the <hi>Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to be obliterated.</p>
               <p>In the year 1616. King <hi>James</hi> had obtained an Act of the General <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Rich. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Book was framed, and ſent up to the King, who himſelf peruſed, reviſed it, referring it alſo to the conſideration of others, in whom he much confided. And after his own and their Obſervation, Additions, Expunctions, Mutations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he returned it to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be commended to that Church: but before a period was put to that buſineſs, the King died.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> underſtanding his Father's intention, in compoſing a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy <note place="margin">1637.</note> for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ordereth the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> together with divers other Biſhops of both Nations, to reviſe and correct (as they ſhould think meet) the Liturgy compiled in his Father's life-time (which very little differeth from that of <hi>England)</hi> ordereth it to be ſent to the Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be made uſe of there.</p>
               <p>On <hi>July</hi> twenty three, 1637. as the Dean of <hi>Edenborough</hi> began to read the Book in St. <hi>Giles</hi> his Church, a ſudden uproar began by the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lambert Wood</hi> of the Life and Reign of King <hi>Charles.</hi>
                  </note> women, and baſer ſort of people. The Biſhop appointed to preach, goes into the Pulpit, hoping to convince them of their irreverent carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which nothing prevailed; for they were the more inſolent, fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtools, ſtones, and whatever elſe came next to hand, at him, ſo that he hardly eſcaped with life. Divers other Churches were infeſted with the like fury: but by the Induſtry of the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> Lord Chancellor, and other Magiſtrates, the tumult was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſome were afterwards apprehended, and endeavours made to find out the firſt beginner.</p>
               <p>But not long after, a great concourſe of people, from all parts of that Kingdom, came to <hi>Edinborough,</hi> which occaſioned the Lords of the Council to put forth ſeveral Proclamations to prevent the like diſorders, but they nothing prevailed. For, the next day, the Biſhop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> going to the Council, was followed by a great multitude reviling him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he came to the Council-door, where he was no ſooner entred, but they beſet the Houſe with very great numbers, threatening deſtruction to all that were within. The Council require aid of the Provoſt, and other Magiſtrates of the City, who return anſwer, that they were in the like danger. The tumult ſtill increaſing, they of the City were forced, for the ſafeguard of their own lives, to ſubſcribe as followeth.</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>To joyn in oppoſition to the Service-book, and to petition againſt it.</hi>

               <p>Which being ſigned, the Council thought was a good ſtep to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the tumult. But entring into the High-ſtreet, the Lord Treaſurer, and other Lords, were freſh aſſaulted, trodden under foot, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53424:163"/> brought back by violence to the Council-houſe; where being in great danger, they require aid of divers Noble-men, diſaffected to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book, who promiſed what aid they poſſibly could, and in the end returned home ſafe.</p>

               <p>Suddenly two Petitions were preſented againſt the Common-prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, and the Compoſers and Abettors of it; which Petitions were ſent to the King (with the narrative of the whole) who immediately <note place="margin">

               <p>Theſe troubleſome beginnings, did afterward occaſion <hi>the ſolemn League and Covenant,</hi> whereby the greateſt part of the Nation united themſelves to defend their Priviledges, as was pretended, and which laid the foundation of a long and woful War in both Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>They erected a new Government among themſelves, which conſiſted of four Tables for the four Orders of the State, <hi>viz.</hi> the Noblemen, <note place="margin">

               <p>The Tables being formed, they reſolved upon renewing the ancient Confeſſion of that <hi>Kirk,</hi> with a Band thereunto ſubjoyned, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the preſent occaſion, which had been ſigned by King <hi>James</hi> on <hi>January 28. Anno</hi> 1580. And by this Band they entred Covenant for maintenance of their Religion then profeſſed, and his Majeſty's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but aiming at the contrary. And to this Covenant they required an Oath of all the Subjects, which was as great an Uſurpation of the Regal power, as they could take upon themſelves, for confirming their own authority, and the peoples obedience, in any project whatſoever, which ſhould afterwards iſſue from thoſe Tables.</p>
               <p>Return we now to <hi>England,</hi> where we ſhall find things in a better condition, at leaſt to outward appearance. And now the Metropolitical viſitation having been carried into all parts of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> began to caſt his eye upon the Iſlands of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The principal Eccleſiaſtical Officer, whilſt they were under the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> had the Title of <hi>Dean,</hi> for each Iſland one; the ſeveral powers, both of the Chanceſlor and Archdeacon, being united in his Perſon.</p>
               <p>This Office is reſtored again, his Juriſdiction marked out, his Fees appointed, his Revenue ſetled; but made accountable for his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to the Biſhop's of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>

               <p>The Engliſh Liturgy is tranſlated alſo into French, to be read in their Churches: Inſtructions firſt, and afterwards a Body of Canons framed, for regulating both Miniſters and people in their ſeveral duties.</p>
               <p>Now it was reſolved, that the Metropolitical viſitation ſhould be held in each of them at the next opening of the Spring. And the Archbiſhop had deſigned a Perſon for his principal Viſitor, who had ſpent ſome time in either Iſland, and was well acquainted with the Bailiffs, Miniſters, and Men of ſpecial note among them.

               <p>The next year he moved for a Proclamation, for the calling in of a Popiſh Book, written in French by <hi>Francis Sales,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi> tranſlated into Engliſh, entitled an <hi>Introduction to a holy life.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was thereupon apprehended, and the Tranſlator diligently ſought for to be brought to Juſtice.

               <p>But that which did moſt generally vindicate the Archbiſhop's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the enlarging and re-printing of his <hi>Conference</hi> with <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuite, even then when the Libellers were moſt fierce againſt him, to which he had been moved by ſome private friends, and afterwards adviſed to it by the King himſelf at the Council.

               <p>The people in many trading Towns, which were near the Sea, having been long diſcharged of the bond of Ceremonies, no ſooner came to hear of the leaſt noiſe of a Conformity, but they ſpurn at it.

               <p>Among the firſt which ſeparated upon this account, were <hi>Goodwyn, Nye, Burroughs, Bridge,</hi> and <hi>Symſon,</hi> who taking ſome of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers with them, betook themſelves unto <hi>Holland.

               <p>It was once under conſultation to ſend a Biſhop over to them, for their better government, and back him with ſome Forces to compel, if he he were not otherwiſe able to perſwade, obedience.</p>
               <p>But this deſign was ſtrangled in the firſt conception, by the violent breakings out of the Troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Covenanters now began to raiſe Arms, levy Souldiers, invite home their Commanders abroad, impoſe Taxes upon the people, ſeize ſome of the King's Caſtles, raiſe Fortifications, prepare for a War, and choſe old <hi>David Leſley</hi> for their General.</p>

               <p>But before the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſcow</hi> was indicted, the Covenanters had ſo laid the plot, that none but thoſe of their own party ſhould have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in it, not ſuffering the Archbiſhops and Biſhops to ſit as Moderators in their Presbyteries. where the Elections were to paſs; and citing them to appear as Criminal perſons at the ſaid Aſſembly. The Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, in the name of themſelves and of all their Adherents, prepared their <hi>declinator,</hi> or proteſtation againſt the ſaid <hi>General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> and all the Acts and Concluſions of it, as being void and null in Law to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever: The day being come, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> marcheth to the place appointed for the Seſſion, in the equipage of an High-Commiſſioner, the Sword and Seal being carried before him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reading of his Commiſſion, the putting in and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>declinator,</hi> the chuſing of <hi>Henderſon</hi> to be Moderator of the Aſſembly, the conſtituting of the Members of it, and ſome debates touching Votes and Suffrages, challenged by <hi>Hamilton</hi> for ſuch as were Aſſeſſors to him, took up all their time, betwixt their firſt meeting and their diſſolution, which was by proclamation ſolemnly declared on the twenty ninth of the ſame month.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the ſaid diſſolution, the Members of the ſaid Aſſembly continued their Seſſion, and therein paſſed many Acts for the utter overthrow of the Polity and Government of the Church.

And albeit his Majeſty, by the ſame Proclamation, had commanded all his Subjects not to yield obedience to any of their Acts and Ordinances, yet thoſe of the Aſſembly were reſolved to maintain their Authority: and not only the Biſhops and Clergy, but alſo as many of the Laity as had refuſed to ſubſcribe to the Acts thereof, were deprived of their Offices and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, baniſhed their Country, and forced to fly into <hi>England,</hi> or other places, the King being unable to protect them from the power and malice of their Adverſaries.</p>

               <p>About the latter end of this year died <hi>John Spottiſwood,</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and was buried near unto King <hi>James</hi> in the Abbey-church of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King began his journey towards the North on <hi>March</hi> twenty ſeven, his Army being advanced before, the chief command whereof was committed to the Earl of <hi>Arundel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scots preſented a Petition to the King at his Camp near <hi>Berwick.</hi> And Commiſſioners being on both ſides appointed, they came at laſt to this concluſion, on <hi>June 17. viz.</hi> firſt, <hi>That his Majesty ſhould confirm whatſoever his Commiſſioner hath already granted in his Majeſties name, and that from thenceforth all matters Eccleſiaſtical ſhould be determined by the Aſſemblies of the</hi> Kirk, <hi>and all matters civil by the Parliament: and to that end a General Aſſembly to be indicted on the ſixth of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on the twentieth of the ſame month, in which Parliament an Act of Oblivion was to paſs for the common peace and ſatisfaction of all parties: that the Scots, upon the publication of the accord, ſhould within forty eight hours disband all their Forces, diſcharge all pretended Tables and Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, reſtore unto the King all his Cuſtles, Forts, and Ammunition of all ſorts: the like reſtitution to be made to all his good Subjects of their liberties, lands, goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>taken and detained from them, ſince the late pretended General Aſſembly at</hi> Glaſcow: <hi>that thereupon the King ſhould preſently recal his Fleet, and retire his Land-forces, and cauſe reſtitution to be made to all perſons of their goods detained, and arreſted, ſince the firſt of</hi> February.</p>
               <p>But as for the proceedings of the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> they ſeem to have been left in the ſame condition in which they ſtood before his Majeſties taking Arms. And the King doing nothing to the abrogating of them, when he was in the Head of a powerful Army, he could not expect, that the Scots could yield to any ſuch abrogation, when he had no ſuch Army to compel obedience.</p>
               <p>And this immediately appeared on his Majeſties ſigning the Agreement, and diſcharging his Army thereupon.</p>
               <p>For the Covenanters, upon the declaration of this accord, produced a Proteſtation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Of adhering to their late General Aſſembly at</hi> Glaſcow, <hi>and to all the proceedings there, eſpecially the ſentences of Deprivation, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, of the ſometimes pretended Biſhops of that Kingdom, as they were termed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Of adhering to their ſolemn Covenant, and declaration of the Aſſembly, whereby the Office of Biſhops is abjured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Biſhops have been malitious Incendiaries of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty againſt this Kingdom by their wicked calumnies; and that if they return to this Kingdom, they be eſteemed, and uſed, as accurſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:53424:166"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That all the entertainers of the excommunicated Biſhops ſhould be orderly proceeded againſt with Excommunication, conform to the Acts and Conſtitutions of this</hi> Kirk.</p>
               <p>They continued their Meetings, and Conſultations, as before they did, maintained their Fortifications at <hi>Leith,</hi> the Port-town to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> and kept their Officers and Commanders in continual pay. His Majeſty hereupon ſent for ſome of the Chiefs of them to come unto him to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> but was refuſed in his Commands. The Earls of <hi>Kinnoul,</hi> and <hi>Traquair,</hi> Chief Juſtice <hi>Elphinston,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> all Privy Counſellors, were pulled violently out of their Coach, on a ſuſpition that ſome Biſhops were diſguiſed among them; that the King might have ſome cauſe to ſuſpect, that there could be no ſafety for him in ſuch a place, and among people ſo enraged, notwithſtanding his great clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy toward them in the <hi>pacification.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>In the firſt meeting of the two, they acted over all the parts they had plaid at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> to the utter abolition of Epiſcopacy, and the ruine of all that adhered to it, their actings in it being confirmed in his name by the High-Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The news whereof cauſed the King to ſend for the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was preſently made Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not long after, with great ſolemnity, created Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in the County of <hi>York.</hi> As Lord Lieutenant he had power to appoint a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he might the better attend the ſervice here without any prejudice to that Kingdom: which Office he committed to <hi>Wansford,</hi> a <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Gentleman, whom he had took along with him into <hi>Ireland</hi> at his firſt going thither.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty was pleaſed to commit the conduct of the Scottiſh Affairs to a Juncto of three, namely, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Marquiſs of <hi>Hammilton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three move his Majeſty to call a Parliament: and it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a Parliament ſhould be called on <hi>April</hi> 13. 1640. In the mean time the Lord Lieutenant held a Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the affair, that an Army of eight thouſand Horſe and Foot was ſpeedily raiſed, and money granted by the Parliament to keep them in pay, to furniſh them with Ammunition, Arms, and all other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>And the Lords of the Council here ſubſcribed largely for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of the War, until ſuch time as the Parliament ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene.</p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:53424:167"/>
               <p>The Scots being informed of the King's preparation for a War, ſent the Earl of <hi>Dumferling,</hi> the Lord <hi>Loudon,</hi> Sir <hi>William Douglas,</hi> and Mr <hi>Barkham,</hi> to repreſent the Affairs of their tranſactions, which were received by the King in a friendly manner.</p>
               <p>Some dayes being unprofitably ſpent in theſe debates, the Archbiſhop, and the reſt of the Committee delegated for this buſineſs, made a report of the whole buſineſs to the reſt of the Council, who came to this reſult, <hi>That ſince the Scots could not be reclaimed to their obedience by other means, they were to be reduced by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Scots as much beſtirred themſelves on the other ſide. Part of the walls of <hi>Edenborough-caſtle,</hi> with all the Ordnance upon it, had fallen down on the nineteenth of <hi>November</hi> laſt, being the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary day of his Majeſties birth, for the repair whereof they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer Timber, nor other Materials, to be carried to it: but on the contrary, they began to raiſe Fortifications againſt it, with an intent to block it up, and render it unuſeful to his Majeſties ſervice. Neither would they ſuffer the Souldiers to come into the Market to recruit their victuals. They made proviſions of great quantity of Artillery, Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Arms, from forreign parts; laid Taxes of ten Marks in the hundred upon all the Subjects; ſcattered abroad many ſeditious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, for juſtifying themſelves, and ſeducing others; ſome of which were burnt, in <hi>England,</hi> by the hand of the Hangman; fortified <hi>Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garvy,</hi> and other places; impriſoned the Earl of <hi>Southesk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and other Perſons of Quality, for their fidelity to the King: took to themſelves the government of <hi>Edenborough;</hi> and employed their Emiſſaries in <hi>England,</hi> to ſollicit them to aid them in maintaining the War againſt their Sovereign.</p>
               <p>But their chief coreſpondence was with <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> they had made ſure of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who governed all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in that Kingdom. In <hi>Ireland</hi> they had a ſtrong party of natural Scots, planted in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> by King <hi>James,</hi> upon the forfeited Eſtates of <hi>Tir-Owen, Tir-Connel, Odighirty,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Wentworth</hi> cruſhed them in the beginning of the combination, ſeizing upon ſuch Ships and Men as came thither from <hi>Scotland,</hi> impriſoning ſome, fining others, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Oath upon the reſt. By which Oath they were bound to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Covenant, not to aid the Covenanters againſt the King, nor to proteſt againſt any of his royal Edicts, as their Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> uſe to do: for the refuſing of which Oath, he fined one Sir <hi>Henry Steward,</hi> and his Wiſe, at no leſs than five thouſand pound a piece, two of their Daughters, and one <hi>James Gray</hi> of the ſame confederacy, at the ſum of three thouſand pound a piece, committing them to priſon for not paying the fines impoſed on them.</p>
               <p>Some Scots having endeavoured to betray the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Carick-fergus</hi> to a Noble-man of that Countrey, the principal Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was executed.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:53424:167"/>
               <p>Finally, The Lord Lieutenant gave a power to the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor,</hi> and other Biſhops of that Kingdom, and their ſeveral Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, to attach the bodies of all ſuch of the meaner ſort, who either ſhould refuſe to appear before them upon citation, or to perform all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Decrees, and Orders, made by the ſaid Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the next Gaol, till they ſhould conform, or anſwer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at the Council-Table.

               <p>In the mean time the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is intent on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Hierarchy, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Scots, and Scotizing Engliſh: and no leſs buſied in digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apology for vindicating the Liturgy commended to the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He took order for tranſlating the Scottiſh Liturgy into the Latin Tongue, that being publiſhed with the Apology which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, it might give ſatisfaction to the world of his Majeſties Piety, and his own great care, the orthodoxy and ſimplicity of the Book it ſelf, and the perverſeneſs of the Scots in refuſing all of it. Which Work was finiſhed, and left with him: the preſent diſtemper of the times, and the troubles which fell heavily on him, putting an end to it in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>He recommended to Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Exon,</hi> the writing of a Book in defence of <hi>the Divine right of Epiſcopacy,</hi> in oppoſition to the Scots and their Adherents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exeter</hi> having undertaken it, ſent the firſt delineations of the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracture to <hi>Lambeth</hi> in the end of <hi>October,</hi> which were generally well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Metropolitan: who having made ſome alterations, ſent them back with many kind expreſſions of a fair acceptance. And ſuch was the freedom he uſed in declaring his judgment in the caſe; and ſuch the Authority which his Reaſons carried along with them, that the Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> found good cauſe to correct his Opinon according to the Rules of theſe Animadverſions; agreeable unto which the Book was writ, and publiſhed not long after, under the name of <hi>Epiſcopacy by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Archbiſhop laboured to ſupport Epiſcopacy on the one ſide, ſome of the adverſe party laboured as much to ſuppreſs it, by lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the branches firſt, and afterwards by laying the Axe to the root of the Tree. <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> a Lawyer of ſome ſtanding, of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> began to queſtion the Biſhop's place and vote in Parliament, their Temporal power, and the authority of the Commiſſion. For being choſen <hi>Reader,</hi> by that Houſe for the <hi>Lent-vacation,</hi> he firſt ſelected for the Argument of his diſcourſings, the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 7. His main deſign was intended chiefly for the defence of ſuch Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as formerly had been granted by the Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> to ſtop the proceedings of the <hi>Court-Chriſtian,</hi> and ſpecially of the High-Commiſſion,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53424:168"/> and in the next place to deny the Authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it ſelf, as before was noted. Hereupon the Archbiſhop informs his Majeſty both of the Man and of his deſign, how far he had gone in juſtifying the proceedings of the Scottiſh Covenanters, in decrying the temporal power of Church-men, and the undoubted right of Biſhops to their place in Parliament: his Majeſty hereupon gives order to <hi>Finch,</hi> the new Lord Keeper, to interdict all further Reading on thoſe points. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was ſoon found, that nothing could be done therein without leave from the King, and no ſuch leave to be obtained without the conſent of the Archbiſhop. To <hi>Lambeth</hi> therefore goes the Reader, where he found no admittance till the third Addreſs, and was then told, <hi>That he was fallen upon a Subject neither ſafe nor ſeaſonable, which ſhould ſtick cloſer to him then he was aware of.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> haſteneth out of Town.</p>
               <p>The Parliament came together on <hi>April</hi> 13. 1640. inſtead of acting <note place="margin">Short view of the life and Reign of King <hi>Charles, p.</hi> 77.</note> any thing for his Majeſties ſervice, they were at the point of paſſing a Vote for blaſting his War againſt the Scots. To prevent which, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was forced to diſſolve them on <hi>May</hi> 5. the Convocation ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, who granted him a Benevolence of four ſhillings in the pound for all their Eccleſiaſtical promotions, to be paid ſix years together then next enſuing.</p>
               <p>The Convocation ſate after the breaking up of the Parliament. A new Commiſſion was brought from his Majeſty, by vertue whereof they were warranted to ſit ſtill, not in the capacity of a Convocation, but of a Synod, to prepare their Canons for the Royal aſſent thereunto. But Doctor <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Oath it ſelf I ſhall ſet down, as I find it in the Life of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> written by Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> in this form following, <hi>viz.</hi>

Nor will I ever give my conſent to alter the Government of this Church by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and Archdeacons, &amp;c. As it ſtands now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and as by right it ought to ſtand; nor yet ever ſubject it to the uſurpations and ſuperſtitions of the See of</hi> Rome. <hi>And all theſe things I do plainly and ſeriouſly acknowledge and ſwear, according to the plain and common ſence and underſtanding of the ſame words, without any equivocation, or mental evaſion, or ſecret reſervation whatſoever. And this I do heartily, willingly and truly, upon the faith of a Chriſtian.</hi> So help me God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Toward the cloſe of the Convocation, Doctor <hi>Griffith</hi> made a motion, that there might be a new Edition of the Welſh Church-bible, ſome ſixty years firſt tranſlated into Welſh by the endeavours of Biſhop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> but not without many miſtakes and omiſſions of the Printer. The matter was committed to the care of the Welſh Biſhops, but nothing was effected therein.</p>
               <p>Near the ending of the Synod <hi>Godfrey Goodman,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> privately acquainted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that he could not in his Conſcience ſubſcribe the new Canons.

               <p>Various were mens cenſures upon theſe Canons. But moſt took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <note place="margin">

Yet others with a favourable ſence endeavoured to qualifie this ſuſpitious clauſe, whereby the taker of this Oath was tied up from conſenting to any alteration, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theſe words, <hi>[We will never give any conſent to alter]</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here to be meant only of a voluntary and pragmatical alteration, when men conſpire and endeavour to change the preſent Government of the Church, in ſuch particulars as they do diſlike, without the conſent of their Superiors.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Goodman,</hi> on <hi>July</hi> the tenth, made acknowledgment of his fault before the Lords of the Council, and took the Oath enjoyned in the ſixth Canon, for preſerving the Doctrines and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all Popiſh doctrines which were thereunto repugnant. Upon the doing whereof he was reſtored, by his Majeſty, to his former liberty. Yet in the time of his laſt ſickneſs, it is ſaid, that he declared himſelf to be a Member of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cauſed it ſo to be expreſſed in his laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>
               <p>On <hi>December</hi> 27. 1639. at night, and the night following, there was ſuch a violent Tempeſt, that many of the Boats, which were drawn to Land at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> were daſhed one againſt the other, and were broke to pieces: and that the ſhafts of two Chimneys were blown down upon <note place="margin">

               <p>A like miſchance happened the ſame night at <hi>Croydon</hi> (a retiring place belonging to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury)</hi> where one of the Pinacles fell from the Steeple, beat down the Lead and Roof of the Church above twenty foot ſquare.</p>
               <p>But that which was more remarkable than either of theſe, was that which happened the ſame night at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Metropolitical Church, where one of the Pinacles upon the top of the <hi>Belfrey</hi>-Tower, which carried a Vane with this Archbiſhop's Arms upon it, was violently ſtruck down, but born a good diſtance from the Steeple, to fall upon the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53424:169"/> Roof of the Cloyſter, where the Armes of the Archiepiſcopal See it ſelf were ingraven in Stone: which Armes being broke to pieces by the fall of the other: on <hi>Friday</hi> night, <hi>January</hi> 24. 1639. he dreamed, that his Father (who died 46. years before) came to him, being to his thinking ſeemingly well and cheerful, that his Father asked him, what he did there: that after ſome ſpeech, he demanded of his Father how long he would ſtay there; and that his Father made this anſwer, he would ſtay till he had him along with him. <hi>Which made ſuch an impreſſion on him, that he thought fit to remember this in his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate.</hi>

               <p>The King therefore reſolves to hold a Parliament, and on <hi>November</hi> 3. 1640. that long laſting Parliament began.

                  <hi>December</hi> 18. Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> were voted by the Commons, Guilty of High Treaſon, and a charge was immediately brought in againſt Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> upon the Reading of which on <hi>March</hi> 1. he was ſent to the Tower.</p>
               <p>The ſame moneth Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> with a great multitude out of <hi>London,</hi> petitioned the Houſe againſt Epiſcopal Government, and the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church. A Committee was appointed to conſider of matters of Religion, ſetled in the Upper Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Ten Earls, ten Biſhops, ten Barons. At the ſame time the Lords appointed a <hi>Sub-committee,</hi> to prepare matters fit for their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance (the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> having the Chair in both) authorized to call together divers Biſhops and Divines, to conſult together for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting what was amiſs, and to ſettle peace, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>The place of their meeting was <hi>Jeruſalem-chamber</hi> in the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter's</hi> houſe, where they had ſolemn debates ſix ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>Firſt they conſult on innovations in Doctrine. Then they enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Preter-canonical conformity, and innovations in Diſcipline; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Common-Prayer. Laſtly, they entred on the Regulating of Eccleſiaſtical Government, which was not brought in, becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> had undertaken the draught thereof, but not finiſhed it, as employed at the ſame time in many weighty matters of State. This conſultation continued till the middle of <hi>May.</hi> But the Bill againſt Deans and Chapters, put ſuch a diſtance between the foreſaid Divines,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53424:171"/> that never their Judgments (and ſcarce their perſons) met after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>The Canons made in the late Convocation were condemned in the Houſe of Commons, as being againſt the King's Prerogative, the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of the Realm, the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and containing divers other things tending to Sedition, and of dangerous conſequence.</p>
               <p>Many things were charged againſt the Archbiſhop by the Scots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he had preſſed upon that Kirk, many Innovations in Religion, contained in the Liturgy and Book of Canons, contrary to the Liberties and Laws thereof.</p>
               <p>That he had required <hi>Ballentine,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> and the reſt of the Biſhops to be preſent at the Divine Service in their <hi>Whites,</hi> and blamed the ſaid Biſhop for his negligence in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he gave order for the taking down Stone-walls and Galleries in the Churches of <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to no other end but for the ſetting up of Altars, and Adoration toward the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>That for their Supplicating againſt theſe Novations, they were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Rebels in all the Pariſh-Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and a War kindled againſt them by his Arts and Practices.</p>
               <p>That their Covenant by him was called ungodly, and that divers Oathes were impoſed upon their Countrey-men to abjure the ſame.</p>
               <p>That he in the preſence of the King ſpared not to rail againſt the General Aſſembly held at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> and put his hand to a Warrant for impriſoning ſome of thoſe Commiſſioners ſent from the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Peace of both Nations.</p>
               <p>That when the late Parliament could not be moved to aſſiſt in the War againſt them, he had cauſed the ſame to be diſſolved, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Convocation, to make Canons againſt them and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the charge exhibited by the Scots Commiſſioners, in which many thought there was nothing criminal enough to deſerve Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much leſs to menace him with death.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> was impeached for many reputed miſdemeanours in the See of <hi>Norwich.</hi> That he deprived or baniſhed, within the ſpace of two years, fifty Godly, Learned, Painful Miniſters. His placing the Communion-Table Altar-wiſe, and cauſing a Rayl to be ſet before it. The practiſing of Superſtition in his own perſon, his bowing toward it; Conſecrating the Bread and Wine at the Weſt-ſide of the Table, with his back toward the people, and elevating the ſame above his Head, that the people might ſee it, cauſing the ſeats in all places to be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53424:171"/> that the people muſt of neceſſity kneel towards the Eaſt. Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no Prayers to be uſed by Preachers before their Sermons, but that preſcribed by the Canon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe troubleſom times died Dr. <hi>John Davenant,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">1641.</note> of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> A little before his death he prayed emphatically for half a quarter of an hour. Among many heavenly paſſages therein, <hi>He thanked God for this his fatherly correction, becauſe in all his life-time he never had any one heavy affliction, which made him often much ſuſpect with himſelf, whether he was a true child of God or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deans and Chapters being now oppoſed by Parliament, the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral-men endeavour to preſerve their Foundations; and by their friends obtain leave to be admitted into the Houſe of Commons, and to be heard what they could alledge in their own behalf. They made choice of Doctor <hi>John Hacket,</hi> Prebendary of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> to be the mouth for all the reſt.</p>

He ſpake much alſo in praiſe of Church-muſick, when moderated to Edification. He took occaſion to refell that ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſome caſt on Lecture-preachers, as an upſtart Corporation, alledging, that the local Statutes of moſt, or all Cathedral Churches, do require Lectures on the week-days. And in the name of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, he requeſted that Honourable Houſe, that godly and profitable Preaching might be the more exacted. Then he inſiſted on the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning, as the proper uſe and convenience of Cathedrals, each of them being a ſmall Academy for the Champions of Chriſt's cauſe, againſt the Adverſaries, by their Learned pens. Here he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to prove by a Catalogue of their Names and Works, which he could produce, that moſt excellent labours in this kind (excepting ſome few) have preceeded from perſons preferred in Cathedrals: Now what a diſheartning would it be to young Students, if ſuch promotions were taken away. He alledged alſo, that the antient and genume uſe of Deans and Chapters; was as <hi>Senatus Epiſcopi,</hi> to aſſiſt the Biſhop in his juriſdiction. He ſaid, that Cathedral-Churches were the firſt Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtianity in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From things he paſſed to perſons, and began with the multitude of ſuch members, as had maintenance from Cathedrals, the total amounting to many thouſands; All which by the diſſolution of Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt be expoſed to poverty. Next, he inſtanced in their Tenants, who holding Leaſes from Deans and Chapters, are ſenſible of their own happineſs (as enjoying ſix parts of ſeven in pure gain) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have petitioned the Houſe to continue their Antient Landlords. Moreover, ſuch Cities wherein Cathedrals ſtand (if Maritime) being
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53424:172"/> very poor in Trade, are enriched by the hoſpitality of the Clergy, and the frequent reſort of Strangers unto them. Then he ſhewed, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of low degree, but generous Spirits, would labour by qualifying themſelves by Induſtry and Vertue, to attain a ſhare of Cathedral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as the common poſſeſſion of the Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He truſted their Honours would account it reaſonable, that the Clergy had in ſome ſort a better maintenance than in neighbouring reformed Churches, and not with <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then he inſtanced in ſome famous forreign Proteſtants, who had found relief by being inſtalled Prebendaries in our Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, as Dr. <hi>Saravia</hi> preferred by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Caſaubon</hi> (Father and Son) by King <hi>James,</hi> Dr. <hi>Primroſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Voſſius,</hi> in the reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Peter Du-Moulin.</hi> And to deſtroy Deans and Chapters would highly gratifie <hi>Rome;</hi> for <hi>Sanders</hi> himſelf ſeemeth to complain, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had left Provoſts, Deans, Canons, and Prebendaries in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foreſaw ſuch Foundations would conduce to the ſtability of Religion.</p>
               <p>He went forward to ſhew how ſuch Lands paid greater ſums to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer for <hi>First-fruits,</hi> tenths and ſubſidies, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than any other Eſtates and Corporations in the Kingdom. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored to find the antient and honourable Juſtice of the Houſe unto his Brethren, who were not charged, much leſs convicted of any Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous faults juſtly for the ſame to forfeit their eſtates. At laſt he ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Honour of God, to whoſe worſhip and ſervice ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks and Lands were dedicated, and barred all alienations with (which he ſaid, is <hi>termenda vox)</hi> curſes and imprecations. He minded them of the cenſures of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Complices, pronounced hallowed, becauſe pretended to do God ſervice therewith. He added that of <hi>Solomon, Prov. 20. 25. It is a ſnare to a man that devoureth that which is holy.</hi> He added alſo that ſmart queſtion of St. <hi>Paul, Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> and concluded, that on the ruines of the rewards of Learning, no ſtructure can be raiſed but ignorance, and upon the Chaos of ignorance, nothing can be built but Profaneneſs and Confuſion. This ſpeech was generally well-reſented, and wrought much on the Houſe for the preſent.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon Dr. <hi>Cornelius Burgeſſe</hi> made a vehement Invective againſt Deans and Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He aggravated the debauchedneſs of Singing men, not onely uſeleſs, but hurtful by their Vicious converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet he concluded with the utter unlawfulneſs to convert ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments to any private perſon's profit.</p>
               <p>Then was a Bill brought up from the Commons to the Lords againſt Biſhops and Clergy-men: and it was Voted.</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>The laſt branches of this Bill paſſed by general conſent, not above two diſſenting. But the firſt branch was Voted by the Lords in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But at laſt it was wholly caſt out.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop adviſed the drawing of a Petition to both Houſes of Parliament in the name of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> not onely for the preſervation of Epiſcopal Government, but of thoſe Foundations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the encouragements and rewards of Learning. In which petition having ſpoken, in few words, of the Antiquity and Succeſſion of Biſhops, from the Apoſtles themſelves, they inſiſt more at large upon ſuch ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions as might beſt juſtifie and endear the cauſe of Cathedral Churches. The like petition came from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as much concern'd in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe as <hi>Oxon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At a ſolemn Faſt, not long after, the Temporal Lords took precedence of the Biſhops, contrary to the cuſtom of their Predeceſſors in all times foregoing: which being obſerved by the Lord <hi>Spencer, Is this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>a day of humiliation, wherein we ſhew ſo great a pride, in taking place of thoſe to whom it was allowed by all our Anceſtors?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bill againſt the High-commiſſion Court, was the third time read in the Houſe of Lords, and paſſed, which ſome days after was confirmed by his Majeſty. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> brought up a Bill to regulate Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and their juriſdiction. This Bill was but once read in the Houſe, and no great matter made thereof. The Biſhops that were impeached for making Canons, craved time till <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term. This was vehemently oppoſed by ſome Lords, and two queſtions were put.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>Whether the Biſhops ſhould fit ſtill in the Houſe, though without voting (to which themſelves conſented) whilſt the circumſtance of time for their anſwer was in debate.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>What time they ſhould have for their anſwer.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt of theſe was carried for them by one preſent voice, and four Proxies; and for the ſecond, time was allowed them till the tenth of <hi>November,</hi> and Councel was permitted unto them. Biſhop <hi>Warner</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> is choſen by joynt conſent to ſolicit the cauſe, ſparing neither care nor coſt therein. Mr. <hi>Chute</hi> drew up a <hi>Demurrer</hi> in their behalf, that their offence in making Canons could not amount to a <hi>Praemunire:</hi> and now the cauſe ſunck in ſilence.</p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:53424:173"/>
               <p>But the main matter was, that the Biſhops were denied all medling even in the Commiſſion of preparatory examinations concerning the Earl of <hi>Strafford, Cauſa ſanguinis;</hi> and they as men of mercy not to deal in the condemning of any perſon. The Biſhops againſt the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> reſolved to keep poſſeſſion of their Votes, till a prevalent power outed them thereof.</p>
               <p>No day paſſed, wherein ſome petition was not preſented to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Biſhops, who durſt not come to the Parliament by Land for fear of the Apprentices, who were gathered together in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Biſhops therefore intended to come to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by water in Barges: but as they thought to come to Land, they were ſo pel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed with Stones, and frighted at the ſight of ſuch a company of them, that they were rowed back, and went away to their places.</p>
               <p>The next day twelve of the Biſhops repaired to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Chamber, in the Dean's lodgings, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d drew up a Proteſtation, directed thus, <hi>To the King's most excellent Majeſty, and the Lords and Peers now aſſembled in Parliament.</hi> This Inſtrument they delivered to Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> now Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> who at the next opportunity preſented it to his Majeſty; who wholly remitted the matter to the Parliament. The next morning a Privy Counſellor brought this Proteſtation into the Houſe: and the twelve ſubſcribers are impeached of High Treaſon, and Voted to be committed to the Tower, ſave that Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> found ſome favour, ſo that they alone were ſent to the cuſtody of the Black Rod.</p>
               <p>Now was the Bill againſt the Biſhops ſitting in Parliament brought up into the Houſe of the Lords, and the matter agitated ſo eagerly on both ſides. The Lord Viſcount <hi>Newark</hi> (afterwards Earl of <hi>Kingſton)</hi> made two notable ſpeeches in the Houſe, in defence of Epiſcopacy, which confirmed thoſe of the Epiſcopal party, making the Lords very zealous in Biſhops behalf. There were in the Houſe many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Epiſcopacy, as <hi>William</hi> Lord Marquis of <hi>Hartford;</hi> the Earl of <hi>South-hampton;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> his Son; and that learned Lord, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> and many other Lords voted for them.</p>
               <p>About this time died <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Joſeph Hall</hi> ſucceeded him in his See. Doctor <hi>John Prideaux, Regius Profeſſor</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> Doctor <hi>Thomas Winniff,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> Doctor <hi>Ralph Brownrigg,</hi> made Biſhop of <hi>Exeter.</hi> Doctor <hi>Henry King,</hi> made Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter.</hi> Doctor <hi>John Weſtfield,</hi> made Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> he died not long after. Theſe were as likely perſons to have kept up Epiſcopacy, if God's providence had ſoappointed, as any could have been culled out of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:53424:173"/>
               <p>The Bill was again brought in againſt Biſhops Votes in Parliament, <note place="margin">1642.</note> and it was clearly carried in the Negative, that Biſhops never more ſhould Vote as Peers in Parliament. The King was very unwilling to conſent to it, but at laſt, with much importunity, he ſigned the Bill, as he was, in St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> paſſing with the Queen towards <hi>Dover,</hi> then undertaking her voyage into the Low Countries.</p>
               <p>Ten of the eleven Biſhops formerly ſubſcribing their Proteſtation to the Parliament, were after ſome moneths durance (upon good bale given) releaſed. Theſe now at liberty ſeverally diſpoſed themſelves. Some went home to their own Dioceſs, as the Biſhops of <hi>Norwich, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, &amp;c.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> continued in <hi>London.</hi> Some withdrew themſelves into the King's quarters, as Archbiſhop <hi>Williams, &amp;c.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> within few moneths after he was diſcharged from the Tower, was ſeized on by a party of Souldiers at his houſe at <hi>Downham,</hi> and brought back again to the Tower, where he continued till the end of the year 1659. As for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as he firſt took poſſeſſion of that fatal lodging before any of the reſt came to him, ſo he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there after their diſmiſſion, without hope of finding his paſſage out of it by any other door than the door of death: which as he did not look for before it came; ſo when it came he did not fear it, ſaith Doctor <hi>Heylin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>October</hi> 23. in the year foregoing, the Houſe of Peers ſequeſtred his Juriſdiction from him, conferring it on Sir <hi>Nathanael Brent,</hi> and others of his under-officers, and ordered, <hi>That He ſhould beſtow none of the Benefices within his Gift, without acquainting them with the name and quality of the party whom he intended to prefer, leaving to them the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if they ſaw cauſe for it.</hi> And on <hi>October</hi> 15. 1642.

               <p>The entertaining of many petitions by the Houſes of Parliament viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tending to the abolition of Epiſcopal government, made it appear moſt neceſſary in the eyes of thoſe who wiſht well to it, to haſten the publiſhing of ſuch petitions, as had been preſented to the King in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half thereof, and by his Majeſty had been ordered to be publiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

               <p>The War now begins to open. The Parliament had their Guards already, and the affront which <hi>Hotham</hi> had put upon the King at <hi>Hull,</hi> prompted the <hi>York ſhire</hi> Gentlemen to become a guard to his Perſon. Both Houſes preſently Vote this to be a levying War againſt the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, for whoſe defence not onely the Trained bands of <hi>London</hi> muſt be in a readineſs, and the Good people of the Countrey required to put themſelves into a poſture of Armes; but Regiments of Horſe and Foot are liſted, a General appointed, great ſums of money raiſed. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King haſtens from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where he ſets up his Standard, inviting all his good Subjects to repair unto him, for defence of their King, the Laws and Religion of their Countrey. And march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with great Forces he was encountred at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Forces, where five thouſand men on both ſides were ſlain on the place, among which was the King's General. Yet the King kept the field, and made his way open, forced <hi>Banbury</hi> Caſtle, and entred triumphantly into <hi>Oxford</hi> with an hundred and twenty Colours taken in the Fight.</p>
               <p>The King reſolves on his advance towards <hi>London,</hi> and goes forward as far as <hi>Brainford,</hi> out of which he beats two of their beſt Regiments, takes five hundred priſoners and ſinks their Ordnance.

               <p>One of the firſt publick Acts which they performed, was the humble preſenting of a petition to both Houſes, for the appointing of a ſolemn Faſt to be generally obſerved. And preſently a Faſt is appointed, and accordingly kept on the following <hi>Friday,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bowles,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Newcomen,</hi> (whoſe Sermons were after Printed) Preaching on the ſame.</p>
               <p>The King ſummons the Lords and Commons to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to attend there on <hi>January</hi> 22. then next following. Being come, ſcarce were they ſetled in their ſeveral Houſes, when they were entertained with an hot Alarum, made by the coming in of the Scots with a puiſſant Army. The Scots had thrived ſo well by the former ſervice, as made them not unwilling to come under the pay of ſuch bountiful Maſters. And knowing well in what neceſſity their dear Brethren in <hi>England</hi> ſtood of their aſſiſtance, they were reſolved to husband that neceſſity to their beſt advantage. The Engliſh muſt firſt enter into Covenant with them, for conforming of this Church with that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt branch of it, it was to be Covenanted between the Nations, <hi>That all endeavours ſhould be uſed for the preſervation of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>both in Doctrine, Diſcipline, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; Directory for worſhip and Catechizing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the ſecond, <hi>That in like manner they endeavour without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, that is, Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, their Chancellors and Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other Eccleſiaſtical Officers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on that Hierarchy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But by whomſoever it was framed, his Majeſty ſaw that it aimed at the ſubverſion of the preſent Government. Therefore looking on it as a dangerous combination againſt himſelf, the eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Laws of this Kingdom, for the bringing in of Forreign Forces to ſubvert them all (ſaith Doctor <hi>Heylin)</hi> interdicted all his Subjects from impoſing, or taking the ſame, as they would anſwer the contrary at their pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ils. Which Proclamation bearing date on <hi>October</hi> 9. came out too late to hinder the taking and enjoying of this Covenant, where the reſtraint thereof had been moſt neceſſary: for it had been ſolemnly taken by all the Members of the Houſe of Commons, and the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines at St. <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on <hi>September</hi> 25. and within two days after it was Adminiſtred with no leſs ſolemnity to divers Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Colonels, Officers, Souldiers, and others, reſiding in and about the City of <hi>London;</hi> a Sermon being Preached by Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> to juſtifie the piety and legality of it: and finally enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be taken on the <hi>Sanday</hi> following, in all Churches and Chappels of <hi>London,</hi> within the lines of Communication; as afterwards by all the Kingdom in convenient time. No ſooner was this Covenant taken, but to let the Scots ſee that they were in earneſt, a further impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53424:177"/> conſiſting of ten Articles, were prepared againſt the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Aſſembly of Divines ſome concurred not with the major part, and were therefore ſtiled, <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> Theſe men crave a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> to be indulged them (who ſince their return out of the <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries</hi> had fallen upon gathering of Congregations in or about the City of <hi>London)</hi> and they excuſed for being concluded by the votes of the Aſſembly. But the Presbyterians highly oppoſed their Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they tax the diſſenting Brethren for Singularity; and ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their ejection out of the Aſſembly, except in ſome convenient time they would comply therewith.</p>
               <p>The Diſſenters ſeaſonably preſented an Apologetical Narrative to the Parliament, ſtiled by them <hi>The moſt ſacred refuge or Aſylum for miſtaken and misjudged innocence.</hi> Herein they petitioned pathetically for ſome favour, whoſe conſcience could not joyn with the Aſſembly in all particulars, concluding with that pityful cloſe, <hi>That they purſued no other Intereſt or deſign, but a ſubſiſtence (be it the pooreſt and meaneſt) in their own land, as not knowing where elſe with ſafety, health, and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to ſet their feet on earth, and ſubſcribed their names,</hi>

               <p>Dr. <hi>William Twiſſe</hi> their Prolocutor died, and Mr. <hi>Charles Herle,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Exeter-colledge</hi> ſucceeded him in his place.</p>
               <p>The Aſſembly met with many difficulties; ſome complained that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> that Great Antiquary, advantaged by his skill in Antiquity, and the Oriental Tongues, ſtudied rather to perplex than inform the Members thereof, as appeared by the fourteen Queries he propounded; whoſe intent was, to give a check to the deſign of thoſe who held Presbytery to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> More trouble was cauſed to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the opinions of the <hi>Eraſtians.</hi> And divers Parliament men hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own power enlarged thereby, made uſe of the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> for a check to ſuch who preſſed Conformity to the <hi>Scotch Kirk</hi> in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Major part of the Aſſembly endeavoured the ſetling the Scotch Government in all particulars: and this was laboured by the Scotch Commiſſioners with all Induſtry and probable means to obtein the ſame. But it could not be effected, nor was it ever ſetled by Act
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53424:177"/> of Parliament, who kept the coercive power in their own hands, ſo that the power of Excommunication was not intruſted with them, but ultimately reſolved into a Committee of eminent perſons of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>On <hi>February</hi> 6. 1646. the <hi>Scots,</hi> according to agreement, quitted <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſſed it. The Parliament voted the King's remove to <hi>Holdenby-houſe,</hi> with reſpect to the ſafety of His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And the Commiſſioners appointed for receiving the King's Perſon came to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 22. The King deſireth two of his Chaplains to be with him, which was denied him, at which he is much troubled. His Majeſty reſolves to keep every Friday a day of Solemn Faſting and Humiliation.</p>
               <p>After His Majeſty had been neer five moneths at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> near a Thouſand Souldiers commanded by Cornet <hi>Joyce</hi> came to <hi>Holdenby</hi> to the King, and told him, that they were come by command from the Army to remove him from that place. His Majeſty demanded, whether they would offer any violence to his Perſon. They all cried, <hi>None.</hi> He alſo deſired, that his Trunks and Papers might not be Riffled and tumbled. They promiſed to ſet a guard on them. Thirdly, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch ſervants to attend him, againſt whom there was no juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. They anſwered, he ſhould. Laſtly he deſired, that nothing be impoſed on him contrary to his Conſcience. They anſwered, it was not their judgement to force any thing againſt Conſcience upon any one, much leſs on His Majeſty. So at one of the Clock His Majeſty went along with them.</p>
               <p>On <hi>June</hi> 28. 1647. His Majeſty was brought to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> attending him, and others: and from thence came to <hi>Caſam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the Parliament was jealous of the King and the Army, leſt they ſhould treat without the conſent of the Parliament. And the Army likewiſe deviſed as many jealouſies and fears of a private engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Subſcribing in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and againſt the Army.</p>

Whereas they beſought His Majeſty to look rather to the Original than to the ſucceſſion of Biſhops, he thought it needful to look at both, the latter being the beſt <hi>Clue</hi> in ſuch intrinſick caſes to find out the former. Laſtly, he profeſſed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Eleven days after the Parliament Divines put in their anſwer to his Majeſties laſt paper. Herein they affirmed, they ſaw not by what warrant the Writ of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles Office was taken forth, that the Governing part ſhould be in the hands of the Biſhops, the Teaching and Sacramentizing in the Presbyters. They alſo ſaid that ſome Fathers acknowledged, that Biſhops were different from Presbyters onely in matter of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They alſo returned, that His Majeſtie's Definition of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government, is extracted out of the Biſhops of later date than Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it is a great blemiſh of their evidence, that the nearer they come to the Apoſtles times (wherein this ſhould be moſt clear to eſtabliſh the ſucceſſion at the firſt) they are moſt doubtful and contradictory one to the other.</p>
               <p>They granted, that a ſucceſſion of men to feed and govern thoſe Churches, by Eccleſiaſtical Writers in compliance with the Language of their own times, were called Biſhops, but not diſtinct from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers. So that if ſuch a ſucceſſion from the Primitive times, <hi>Seriatim</hi> were proved, they would either be found <hi>more</hi> than Biſhops, as Apoſtles and extraordinary perſons; or <hi>leſs,</hi> as meerly firſt Presbyters, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the three Eſſentials of Epiſcopal government inſiſted on by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. They humbly moved His Majeſty, that the Regiments of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimonies on both ſides might be diſcharged the field, and the point of diſpute tried alone by dint of holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>They affirmed alſo, that the power of Epiſcopacy under Chriſtian and Pagan Princes is one and the ſame, though the exerciſe be not but acknowledging the ſubordination thereof to the Sovereign Power, with their accountableneſs to the Laws of the Land. They conclude with thanks to His Majeſtie's Condeſcenſion in vouchſafing them the Liberty and Honour in examining his Learned Reply, praying God, that a Pen in the Hand of ſuch Abilities might ever be employ'd in a ſubject worthy thereof. Some dayes after His Majeſty returned His laſt paper, wherein he not onely acknowledgeth the great pains of theſe Divines to inform his judgement, according to their perſwaſions, but alſo took ſpecial notice of their Civilities of the Application, both in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Body of their ſupply. However he told them, they miſtook his meaning about a <hi>Writ of Partition,</hi> as if His Majeſty had Cantoned out the Epiſcopal Government, one part to the Biſhops, another to the Presbyterians alone: whereas his meaning was, that the Office of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53424:181"/> Teaching is common to both alike; but the other of Governing peculiar to Biſhops alone.</p>
               <p>The Lords and Commons vote their Commiſſioners return from the Treaty. The Commons debate of his Majeſties Propoſitions, and agree.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That he be in Honour, Safety, and Freedom, according to the Lawes.</hi>

But his Majeſty had not been long among the Scots, but they began (according to their uſual manner of <hi>Kirk</hi> Authority and Diſcipline) to obtrude upon the King ſuch curbing conditions, as but ill-ſuited with Regal dignity.</p>
               <p>Then the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> ſent an Army againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> is made General of the Parliament's Forces inſtead of Lord <hi>Fairfax:</hi> and about the end of <hi>June</hi> he marched towards <hi>Berwick</hi> in order to his advance into <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Scots raiſe an Army, and in the mean-time ſend many Expoſtulatory Letters to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigg</hi> then at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> urging the breach of Covenant, and the union between the two Nations, which availed nothing.</p>
               <p>The Scots having been routed at <hi>Muſcleburgh,</hi> they came to a Battel at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where the whole Army was defeated by <hi>Cromwel:</hi> of the Scots there were ſlain in the Battel four thouſand, and nine thouſand were taken priſoners, with all their Ammunition, bag and baggage, and ten thouſand Armes.

The Scots aſcribed this overthrow of the Army to their admitting the King into <hi>Scotland,</hi> before he had given full ſatisfaction to the Kirk in what they required of him; and began very much to impoſe upon him, and remove from his Perſon the moſt Faithful and Loyal of his Servants.

By this diviſion <hi>Cromwel's</hi> Conqueſt was made very eaſie: and his fomenting that Rent in their Church, made their ſubjection to his Authority more laſting than otherwiſe it would have been.</p>
               <p>The King was deſirous to compoſe this diſorder, or (at leaſt) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the dividing ſo great a Force, as was under <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Straughan</hi> from his Service: and to that end the Earl of <hi>Caſſels,</hi> the Lord <hi>Broody,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> the Miniſter, were ſent to treat with them; but they were ſomewhat averſe to a compoſure; yet they declared againſt any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> profeſſing equally againſt Malignants (as they called the King's Loyal Subjects) and Sectaries.

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. The Officers of the Army conſult about change of Government: on <hi>April 20. Cromwel, Lambert, Hariſon,</hi> and eight Officers more of the Army, entred the Houſe of Commons, and after a ſhort ſpeech made by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> ſhewing ſome reaſons for the neceſſity of their diſſolution, he declared them diſſolved, and required them to depart: but the Speaker would not leave the Chair till <hi>Hariſon</hi> pulled him out by the Arm. Then <hi>Cromwel</hi> commanded the Mace to be taken away, and no more to be carried before him. Then they cauſed the doors of the Parliament Houſe to be locked up, and placed a Guard thereon to prevent the reaſſembling of the Members.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing done after this change, was to conſtitute a Council of State of the chief Officers of the Army. Theſe agreed upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons all over <hi>England</hi> to form a new Repreſentative, and a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was ſent to every one of them in the name of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General of all the Forces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to take upon them the truſt to which they were ſummoned, and to meet at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> on <hi>July</hi> 5.

               <p>About four dayes after the Officers of the Army had prepared an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or Syſteme of Government, on which the foundation of a new Dominion was to be erected, and they entreated <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to accept of the Government under the Title of <hi>Protector of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of</hi> England, Scotland, <hi>and</hi> Ireland.

                  <hi>The</hi> Presbyterian <hi>was rather tolerated than countenanced, and yet ſuch of them as would comply with his Court-greatneſs became his Favourites, for others of them he cared not, pleaſingly expreſſing himſelf, how he had brought under the pride and arrogance of that Sect, making thoſe that would allow no liberty to others, to ſue for it themſelves.</hi>

They were reſtrained in little more than the power of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing General Aſſemblies (their Presbyteries being permitted to convene) and the rigour of Excommunication; for whereas before perſons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated were not only excluded from the communion of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> but had all their Eſtates confiſcated till their reconciliation This latter part was not now to be executed; but to pleaſe the Miniſters for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of their power, the maintenance of Scholars in Univerſities of <hi>Scotland</hi> was encreaſed, and many priviledges were granted to them.</p>

Alderman <hi>Viner</hi> and <hi>Pack</hi> were made Treaſurers for this Money, which amounted to a very large fum: but how much came to the hands of thoſe for whom it was pretended to be collected, I know not. The French King accommodated the buſineſs, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> refuſing to admit <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s mediation.</p>
               <p>Upon the tendring of certain Propoſals, to the Protector, by <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh Ben-Iſrael,</hi> a Jewiſh Merchant, in the behalf of his Hebrew Nation, for their free admiſſion to Trade, and exerciſe of their Religion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a Conference was held about it, ſeveral dayes at <hi>White-hall,</hi> by the Members of the Council, and certain Divines of the greateſt note among them: and many Arguments being urged <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> thoſe againſt their admiſſion ſo far prevailed, that the Propoſals took no effect. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> wrote a Book, at the ſame time, againſt their admiſſion.</p>
               <p>Then was an Ordinance made by the Protector, with the advice of his Council, for the Relief of Miniſters put into ſequeſtred Livings, againſt Moleſtations, and Suits, by Parſons ſequeſtred and ejected.</p>
               <p>On <hi>September</hi> the ſeventeeth, 1656. a Parliament aſſembled at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and choſe for their Speaker Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington.</hi> Now <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice</hi> was framed, which was a Module of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with which they ſeveral times waited on the Protector at <hi>White-hall,</hi> to deſire him to take the chief Government of the Nations upon him, with the Title of <hi>King;</hi> of which the power he already had; the name only he wanted. He finding his Officers averſe to it, at laſt returned anſwer, <hi>That he could not take the Government upon him with that Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now was <hi>James Nailor,</hi> the great Ring-leader of the Sect called <hi>Quakers,</hi> brought to his Trial, who having ſpread his Doctrine, and gained many Proſelites to it in divers parts of the Nation, was more eſpecially taken notice of at <hi>Exeter, Wells,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and from
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53424:188"/> 
                  <hi>Briſtol</hi> was brought up to <hi>London,</hi> attended by ſeveral Men and Women of his Opinion, who all the way they came ſtrewed Gloves and Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs in his way, and ſang <hi>Hoſannah</hi>'s to him, and (blaſphemouſly) are ſaid to have uſed the ſame kind of expreſſions toward him, as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the people of the Jews did to our Saviour, when he rode in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>Jeruſalem. Nailor</hi> being convented before the Parliament, was charged of Blaſphemy, for aſſuming to himſelf Divine honours, and ſuch Attributes as were due to Chriſt only. He was ſentenced by the Houſe to be (firſt at <hi>London)</hi> publickly whipt, pillored, and ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and bored through the Tongue with a red hot Iron, as a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: then to be conveyed to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> there to be alſo whipt; laſtly, to be brought back to <hi>London,</hi> to remain in <hi>Bridewel</hi> during pleaſure; which Sentence was inflicted upon him.</p>
               <p>At this time the viperous brood of Sects, and Hereſies, ſwarmed through all parts of the Nation. Then the Ranters began to multiply, and the Socinians, who denied the Divinity of Chriſt; and one <hi>Biddle</hi> was infamous for theſe Opinions; and <hi>Erbury,</hi> formerly a Miniſter in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diff</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> degenerated unto Ranting.</p>
               <p>The Compiler of this Treatiſe once heard this <hi>Erbury</hi> ſpeak in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation, near <hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire,</hi> of a threefold Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God to his Church and People. <hi>There hath been</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a twofold diſcovery of God to his People, or a two-fold Diſpenſation, namely, the Diſpenſation of the Law and the Goſpel, and God diſcovered himſelf to his People in both Diſpenſations diverſly. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Law God diſcovered himſelf to his people in a way of fear: therefore God was called the great and fearful God, and the delivery of the Law to</hi> Moſes <hi>was in a fearful manner. Now when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, he ſaith,</hi> You have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>&amp;o. that is</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>now when the Goſpel came, men knew God to be a Father, and they in the Spirit of Adoption cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Abba, Father.</p>
               <p>He added, <hi>That under the Law God was known as a Lord, and Maſter, to keep his People in work; and as they had their work, ſo they had their wages; and if they did not work, they had terrors upon their ſpirits to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them. But under the Goſpel, God was diſcovered to be a Father full of Light and Love, ſo that now we converſe with God in a loving manner, and ſerve him as a Son ſerveth his Father.</hi>—</p>
               <p>He proceeded to tell us, <hi>That there is a third Diſpenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion yet to come in the laſt dayes, wherein God will diſcover himſelf in a more fearful way, and yet in a way more full of light and love than in former times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He added, <hi>That then there will be a fuller diſcovery of God, than hath been both under the Law and Goſpel: and the ignorance of this</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>hath been the cauſe of all the confuſions, and contentions, among the People of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:53424:189"/>
               <p>He ſaid, <hi>That the Apoſtles waited for this Diſpenſation, another ſtate more glorious than any they had yet attained unto. This glorious Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (he told us) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>calls,</hi> The Glory to be revealed in us, the glorious liberty of the Sons of God; <hi>and that St.</hi> Peter <hi>calls it,</hi> The new Heaven, and new Earth, <hi>and St.</hi> John, The new Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <hi>That the Myſtery of the Goſpel, which was preached by the Apoſtles, was hid from men; they knew not the myſtery of it: but the time will come, that this myſtery of the Goſpel will come forth in a fuller diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very than hath been heretofore made known.</hi> But I ſhall trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no further with him.</p>
               <p>On <hi>April</hi> the nineteenth, 1657. at a certain Houſe in <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> were apprehended a diſcontented party, formerly in the Army, that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Fifth Monarchy-men,</hi> ſuch as taking upon them to be the Champions of Chriſt's Monarchy on Earth, renounced all Monarchy beſides: the chief of whom were <hi>Thomas Venner,</hi> a Wine-Cooper, Predicant, <hi>Aſhton, Hopkins, Gowler,</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> their Scribes. They had appointed to have rendezvouz that night at <hi>Mile-end-Green,</hi> and thence to have marched into ſome other Counties, to joyn with others of their party, that were ready to ſhew themſelves upon the firſt opportunity. There was taken with them a great quantity of Arms, and certain printed Papers that were to be diſperſed, and a Standard with a <hi>Lion couchant, Gules, in a Field Argent,</hi> having this Motto, <hi>Who ſhall rouze him up?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo taken Major General <hi>Hariſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Lawſon,</hi> late Vice-Admiral, Colonel <hi>Rich, Carew</hi> and <hi>Courtney,</hi> and Major <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> whereof the firſt was committed to the Serjeant at Armes, and the reſt were ſent to remote Caſtles and Priſons. General <hi>Monk</hi> had order to ſeize Major General <hi>Overton,</hi> and the Majors <hi>Bramſton</hi> and <hi>Holmes,</hi> and caſhier them after Fines and good Security for their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>Overton</hi> was ſent up to the Tower, and his Regiment conferred on Colonel <hi>Morgan:</hi> Colonel <hi>Okey</hi>'s Regiment was alſo taken from him, and given to a ſure Confider: and one Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> a great Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, was taken at <hi>Marleborough,</hi> enditing and drawing Declarations againſt the Protector; ſo the danger from the Army was ſoon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time a Book was publiſhed, called <hi>Killing no Murther,</hi> wherein it was urged, <hi>That it was moſt lawful, juſt, neceſſary, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to kill the Protector;</hi> and this printed with the name of one <hi>Allen,</hi> a disbanded Leveller, but ſo politely written, that it intimated a more exact and curious hand that framed it.

This made him moſt ſuſpitiouſly fearful, ſo that he began to dread every perſon, or ſtrange face he ſaw, (which he would anxiouſly, and intently, view) for an Aſſaſſinate, that Book perpetually running in his mind. It is ſaid, it was his conſtant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom

               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> iwenty ſix, 1657. Then followed the Protector's Inſtalment, in a more ſolemn manner, in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> than before: and the Speaker of the Parliament, Sir <hi>Thomas Widdrington,</hi> in the name of the Parliament, preſented to him a Robe of Purple-velvet, a Bible, Sword, and a Scepter, and having made a Speech thereupon, the Speaker took the Bible, and gave the Protector his Oath. Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> Miniſter then of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> made a Prayer, wherein he recommended the Protector, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Council, the Forces by Sea and Land, Government, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the three Nations, to the protection of God. Which being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Heraulds by Trumpets proclaimed <hi>Cromwell</hi> Protector of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions thereunto belonging, requiring all perſons to yield him due obedience.</p>
               <p>Then were the attempts of the Royal Party, in behalf of his Majeſty, betrayed, and diſcovered to the Protector, and Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby,</hi> Doctor <hi>Huet,</hi> Miniſter of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> and others are impriſoned, and brought to trial before an High Court of Juſtice, ſet up under the Preſidentſhip of Commiſſioner <hi>Liſle.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> and the Doctor, were the two firſt that were brought to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and both of them ſentenced to die as Traitors: the firſt upon the bare teſtimony of thoſe three men, who had ſo treacherouſly circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, which in vain he pleaded: the other, as a Mute, diſowning the Authority of the Court, and thereupon denying to plead. On the eighth of <hi>June,</hi> 1658. they were beheaded on Tower-hill. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, on <hi>July</hi> the ſeventh, Colonel <hi>Edward Aſhton,</hi> and <hi>John Bettley,</hi> were hanged and quartered, the firſt in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi> the other in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1658. the Protector was taken ſick at <hi>Hampton-court,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not been well in mind ſome time before (troubled with the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted words of his beloved Daughter <hi>Cleypole,</hi> who died on the ſixth day of <hi>Auguſt)</hi> which went near to his heart. After a weeks time his Diſeaſe began to ſhew very deſperate ſymptomes: wherefore he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where his Chaplains kept Faſts for his recovery: but having declared his Son <hi>Richard</hi> his Succeſſor, he died on Friday, <hi>September</hi> the third, at three of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>The deceaſed Protector's Will, concerning his Succeſſor, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the Council, and chief Officers of the Army, they all conſent

After the Proclamation, the Lord Mayor preſented his Sword to him, which he preſently returned: and after ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies paſſed, (the Council, and many Officers of the State, and of the Army being preſent) <hi>Nathanael Fiennes,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners of the Great Seal, adminiſtred an Oath unto him.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman was ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was chief Governor of that Kingdom, to acquaint <hi>Henry Cromwell</hi> with the preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>England:</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Clarges</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to General <hi>Monk,</hi> to ſee how he ſtood affected to <hi>Richard</hi>'s advancement.

The General Council of Officers (as they called themſelves) met in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Houſe, where they acted with as much formality, as if they had been the ſupreme Legiſlators of the three Kingdoms. At length things came to this iſſue, the young Protector was forced to ſign a Commiſſion to Commiſſioner <hi>Fiennes,</hi> for the diſſolving of the Parliament, and a Proclamation came forth, in the Protector's name, to publiſh the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Parliament.</p>

               <p>The Houſe ſignifie their diſpleaſure, and vote againſt the effect of the Petition. Then the Officers reſolve upon more moderate Propoſals. Another Petition is brought into the Council of Officers more high than the former.

The Council of Officers perceiving, that the Parliament labour to alter the Conſtitution of the Army, labour to get Subſcriptions to their Repreſentation, and Petition. They ſend a Letter to General <hi>Monk</hi> concerning their Repreſentation. He reſolves to admit of no Subſcriptions in <hi>Scotland.</hi> General <hi>Monk</hi> is courted by the Parliament, and complemented by Letters, with gratulatory Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his good ſervice.</p>
               <p>The Houſe takes the Armies debates into conſideration, and anſwers them one by one Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monk</hi> arrives from <hi>Scotland</hi> with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Orders from the General to Mr. <hi>Clarges.</hi> The houſe ordereth, That the Commiſsions of <hi>Lambert,</hi> and others be made void.

               <p>The next day divers of the chief Officers of the Army met at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and choſe ten Army-Officers to be managers of the State Affairs <hi>pro tempore.</hi> They agree, that <hi>Fleetwood</hi> ſhould be Commander in chief of all the Armies, and that <hi>Limbert</hi> ſhould be the next chief Officer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and Colonel <hi>Desborow</hi> Commiſſary General of the Horſe; and that all the Officers to be conſtituted in the Army, ſhould be nominated by Sir <hi>Henry Vane, Fleetwood, Lambert, Desborow, Ludlow,</hi> and <hi>Berry.</hi> They diſpatch Colonel <hi>Cobbet</hi> to General <hi>Monk</hi> with a large Narrative of the Reaſons of their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Now was Mr. <hi>Armorer</hi> ſent by the Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> to the King, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him how matters went in <hi>England.</hi> The Council of Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult about a frame of Government.

               <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> writes to <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> complaining of their violation of Faith to the Parliament, declaring his reſolution to endeavuor to reſtore them to their power, againſt all oppoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

He ſignifies his reſolution to ſeveral of his Officers to march into <hi>England,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the Parliament, and hath their conſent and encouragement.</p>
               <p>He marcheth to <hi>Edinborough,</hi> and there orders all things to his beſt advantage.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> at a Council of Officers, it was adviſed, that ſome way ſhould be uſed to draw off the Independent Churches in <hi>England</hi> from favouring the Engliſh Army, which would have much weakened
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53424:192"/> that party, if it had ſucceeded; for moſt of the Inferiour Officers were of that perſwaſion. For the effecting of this, a Declaration was framed, agreed to, publiſhed and diſperſed all over <hi>England:</hi> and at the ſame time another <hi>Declaration</hi> was alſo made to ſatisfie the Kingdom in general with his proceedings.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> invite's <hi>Ludlow</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> to a Conjunction with him. Colonel <hi>Lilburn</hi> at <hi>York</hi> with what forces he could draw together, makes all poſſible oppoſition againſt General <hi>Monk,</hi> and intercepts the General's Letters to Major General <hi>Morgan. Talbot</hi> and <hi>Clarges</hi> come to <hi>Edinburgh Novem.</hi> 2. and are well-received by the General.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Monk</hi> take's hold, for his advantage, of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s overture for a Treaty. Colonel <hi>Clobery,</hi> Colonel <hi>Wilks,</hi> and Major <hi>Knight,</hi> are choſen to be the General's Commiſſioners in this Treaty.

The Army of Horſe and Foot with <hi>Lambert</hi> amounted to neer twelve thouſand, and <hi>Monk</hi> had not above half the number: but General Monk paid all his men, which the other did not.</p>
               <p>Major General <hi>Morgan</hi> take's his journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> to General <hi>Monk,</hi> and his joyning with the General was a matter of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

               <p>The ruling Faction in <hi>Ireland</hi> declare their reſolution not to joyn with General Monk. But Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> Sir <hi>Theophilus Jones,</hi> and a conſiderable part of the Army reſolve to aſſiſt him.

               <p>In the mean-time the Commiſſioners for the Independent Churches, which were ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were ſollicitious to divert <hi>Monk</hi> from the proſecution of the War: there was a conference appointed with them at <hi>Holy-rood-houſe,</hi> where were preſent to treat with them Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk,</hi> Colonel <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Colonel <hi>Syler,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> the Judge Advocate of the Army, and Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> one of the General's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> (who had been one of the Preachers to the late Council in <hi>Scotland)</hi> was admitted to be preſent there as a Newter.</p>

That the Churches had not given them Commiſſion to enter into the merits of the cauſe, nor to debate whether <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Action of turning out the Parliament were juſtifiable or not, but onely to preſent it to his Lordſhip, as their opinion, That though that Action could not be juſtified, yet his Lordſhip had not a call to appear againſt it in that manner that he then did, That his Lordſhip had onely in charge to keep <hi>Scotland</hi> in quiet, and was not bound to take notice of any differences in <hi>England.</hi> He proceeded to ſhow reaſons why the General ſhould proceed no further, telling him, that it would put a ſtrife among thoſe that hitherto had been Brethren engaged all along in the ſame cauſe, partakers in the ſame dangers, and the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, among thoſe that ſtill in their Papers and all their Addreſſes, called and owned one another for Brethren; and that at a very unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, whilſt the Canaanites and Perizzites were in the Land. He inſiſted on all the advantages the King and his Party would reap by this quarrel, and all the dangers the people of God (for ſo he called his own party) might run into. At laſt he told the General, that what Inconveniences ſoever ſhould happen would be laid at his door, in regard he would appear to have been the beginner of the War.</p>
               <p>At this the General interrupted him, ſhewing that the war was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun by <hi>Lambert</hi> and his party, who had offered violence to thoſe from whom they had all received their Commiſſions: not ſparing largely to lay open their reſtleſs Inſtability, which would not ſuffer the three nations to enjoy any ſetled Government at all, but kept them in a perpetual circumvolution, till they were in danger to be brought to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine; and Declaring, That if they continued in that courſe, he was reſolved to oppoſe them to the uttermoſt, and would (to repeat his own words) lay them on their backs.</p>

Counſellors of State, paſsing an Act for their Conſtitution, and ſeveral Inſtructions for them to Act by: among which it was provided, that none ſhould ſit, but ſuch as ſhould take an Oath of Abjuration of the King, His family, and Government. The Oath was oppoſed by divers of the Houſe. <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> are ſent from the Houſe to complement and attend General <hi>Monk</hi> upon his journey. Mr. <hi>Clarges</hi> gives him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how affairs ſtand at <hi>London:</hi> he ſends a letter by Mr. <hi>Clarges</hi> to the Houſe from St. <hi>Albans.</hi> Several addreſſes are made to him in his March, pleading for a free Parliament. He marcheth with his forces
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53424:193"/> into the City of <hi>London.</hi> Being come to the Council of State, the Oath of Abjuration was tendred to him, which he refuſeth to take. He is conducted with much Ceremony into the Houſe, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the gratulations of the Houſe. The City continued male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, whereupon the General is Ordered by the Council of State to march into the City, and pull down the Gates and Percullices of the City, which he unwillingly cauſed to be done. The ſame day a Factious party of Citizens preſented a Petition to the Houſe by one <hi>Praiſe-God Barebone</hi> to countenance the Action.</p>
               <p>The General ſends a letter to the Houſe ſigned by Himſelf and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers, complaining againſt the admiſsion of <hi>Ludlow</hi> and others into the Houſe, that had been by Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> accuſed of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and that they had countenanced too much a late Petition, to exclude the moſt ſober and conſcientious both Miniſters and others by Oaths, from all employment and maintenance: he requeſted them, that by Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next they ſhould Iſſue out Writs to fill up their Houſe, and when fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould riſe in ſome ſhort time, to give place to a full and free Palia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> are ſent from the Houſe to the General with their anſwer to his letter.</p>
               <p>The General excuſeth his late proceedings in the City before the Lord Mayor and Common Council of the City. He tells them what he had written to the Houſe touching a free Parliament: The City joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the news of a free Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Council of State write to him to deſire his preſence with them: but he excuſeth his ſtay in the City for ſome longer time, till the minds of the Citizens were more compoſed. The City, and Chief Officers of his Army diſſwade him from going to <hi>White-hall.</hi> The General is ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited from all parts to admit the ſecluded Members. He admits of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference before him, of the ſitting with ſome of the ſecluded Members. The Officers of the Army conſent to the admiſsion of the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon certain conditions: The General and the Officers at length agree upon their admiſsion: and on the Tueſday morning following they were guarded to the Houſe, and took their places in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Then was a letter ſigned by the General and his Chief Officers drawn up, and Copies of it ſent to all the Regiments and Garriſons in <hi>England,</hi> and to the Commanders in Chief of the Armies in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to acquaint them with what he had done.</p>
               <p>The Parliament repealed the Act for the Council of State and the Oath of Abjuration, and paſſed an Act for another Council, conſiſting of one and thirty perſons, moſt of them men of integrity, and well-affected to Kingly government.</p>
               <p>Then the General ſends Colonel <hi>Fairfax</hi> to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Hull,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Overton</hi> ſubmits to his Orders. The Army in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:53424:194"/> were well-ſatisfied with the General's Actions. About the thirteenth of <hi>March</hi> the Parliament abrogated the Engagement appointed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be taken by each Member of Parliament, in theſe words, <hi>viz. [I do declare and promiſe, That I will be true and faithful to the Common Wealth of</hi> England, <hi>as the ſame is now eſtabliſhed without King, or Houſe of Lords,]</hi> and appointed it ſhould be taken off the file, and made Null.</p>
               <p>The Common Wealth Faction deſire the General rather to take the Government upon himſelf, than to bring in the King; and treat with him about it. The General refuſeth their offer.

               </p>
               <p>The Council of State appointed by the late Parliament ſet forth a Proclamation for the preventing of tumults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> eſcape's out of the Tower. Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> and Colonel <hi>Streater</hi> march againſt <hi>Lambert,</hi> defeat his party, and take him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. Colonel <hi>Lambert,</hi> Colonel <hi>Cobbet,</hi> and Major <hi>Creed,</hi> are ſent priſoners to the Tower. Hereupon ſeveral ſeditious Pamphlets were publiſhed in Print, and diſperſed to deprave the mindes of the people; and Tickets were thrown into the Courts of Guard in the night to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Souldiers. But none of them was penned with more virulency and malice, than that ſuppoſitious paper, carrying in it's Frontiſpiece, <hi>A letter from</hi> Bruxels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Several letters were alſo ſent to the General from unknown hands. Then came forth a Declaration of the Nobility and Gentry that adhered to the late King, reſiding in and about the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A new Parliament met at <hi>Weſtminſter, April</hi> 25. 1660. The Lords choſe the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to be their Speaker; and the Houſe of Commons Sir <hi>Harbottle Grimſton.</hi> On <hi>April</hi> 27. Sir <hi>John Greenvil</hi> preſents the General with a Commiſſion from His Majeſty, to Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute him Captain General of all the Armies of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and a letter for the Council of State. The Letter had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in it, which were both read in the Houſe. After the reading thereof the Houſe of Lords voted, That according to the Antient and fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, the Government is, and ought to be, by King, Lords, and Commons.</p>
               <p>The Officers of the Army preſent an Addreſs to the General in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with His Majeſtie's Letter and Declaration: it is read by the Commons, and approved. Commiſſary <hi>Clarges</hi> is appointed by the General to wait upon the King with this Addreſs. Six of the Lords and of the Commons, and divers Aldermen, and divers Epiſcopal and Presbyterial Divines, and ſome other eminent Citizens are ſent to attend on his Majeſty at <hi>Breda.</hi> His Majeſtie's Letter and Declaration to the Fleet, by the diligence of General <hi>Mountague,</hi> had the ſame ſucceſs
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53424:194"/> there, as that in the Army, being gratefully received by all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Three days after, the Lords and Commons having agreed upon a Proclamation to that purpoſe, His Majeſty was Proclaimed with great ſolemnity in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> being preſent. Mr. <hi>Clarges</hi> carrieth the happy tidings hereof with a Letter from the General to His Majeſty at <hi>Breda.</hi> Thereupon M. <hi>Clarges</hi> is Knighted by His Majeſty. The Parliament's and Cities Commiſſioners have their audience from His Majeſty at the <hi>Hague.</hi> The King afterwards landed at <hi>Dover</hi> with the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen. There the General met him, upon whoſe motion for His going to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the King haſtned to His Coach, in His paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to which he was met by the Mayor and Aldermen of the Town, with Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> the Miniſter, who preſented His Majeſty with a large Bible with Golden Claſps. At His entrance into <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he was met by the Mayor and Aldermen, and Mr. <hi>Lovelace</hi> the Recorder, who made an eloquent ſpeech to Him: the Mayor alſo preſented Him with a Tankard of Maſſie Gold, and then conducted Him to the Palace, where He remained till Monday. From <hi>Canterbury</hi> He marcheth magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently attended to <hi>London.</hi> When he came to S. <hi>George</hi>'s fields, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen on their Knees Reverenced His Majeſty, and the Lord Mayor preſented His Sword unto Him, which His Majeſty gave back to him: from thence He was in a Triumphant and Glorious manner attended and conducted through the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>White-hall,</hi> On <hi>May</hi> 29. 1660. being His birth-day.</p>
               <p>The Lord Mayor having taken leave of Him, He went to the Lords, where He was entertained with a grave and eloquent ſpeech of the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> and from thence to the Banquetting-houſe, where the whole Houſe of Commons attending Him, the Speaker in their names expreſſed the joyful ſence they all had to behold His Majeſty return'd in ſafety, and thereby an end was put to that Tyranny and Slavery His good people had endured. His Majeſty in brief expreſſeth his gracious intentions to them. Then His Majeſty gave thanks to God in His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence-chamber, for all His deliverances and mercies toward him. <hi>May</hi> 31. He ſets forth a Proclamation againſt debauchery and profaneneſs. The Chief Officers of State, and of the King's Houſhold, and the Lords of His Majeſtie's Privy Council, are conſtituted. The Commons ſet upon the Act of General Pardon. On <hi>June</hi> 4. the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance were taken by both Houſes of Parliament, the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Officers of His Houſhold. His Majeſtie's arrival is congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated by the People from all parts of the Nation, and by ſeveral of the Nobility and Gentry both of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The King on <hi>July</hi> 5. is magnificently entertained with the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>

               <p>On <hi>Auguſt</hi> 19. among other Acts, an Act was paſſed by the King and Parliament for a perpetual Anniverſary Thankſgiving on <hi>May</hi> 29. the day of His Majeſtie's Nativity and Reſtauration. An Act alſo was paſſed for a general Pardon, Indempnity, and Oblivion, in which among other things that were excepted, all accounts of the Revenues of Churches in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> and all Judgements of diſcharge, or <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etus eſt</hi> thereupon had.</p>
               <p>This Exception as to the Churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> was inſerted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in this Act, upon information, that ſome factious people had, in the time of the late uſurpation, procured to themſelves an Authority to Sequeſter all thoſe Revenues, upon pretence to employ them more equally to illiterate Preachers, for the better propagation of the Goſpel in thoſe parts, but kept the greateſt part to their own uſe, leaving moſt of the Churches unſupplied.</p>
               <p>All offences alſo done by any Popiſh Prieſt, Seminary, or Jeſuite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Statute of the 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> were excepted.</p>
               <p>Many of the late King's judges were excepted from pardon. All Truſtees in a pretended Act made <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. concerning Tithes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Fee-farm rents, and Firſt-fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their heirs, were
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53424:195"/> to be accomptable for ſuch of the ſame as had not been employed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid Act: nevertheleſs, no Miniſter or School-maſter, or other perſon, for whoſe benefit the ſaid Act was made, were to be accomptable.</p>
               <p>The King on <hi>September</hi> 13. 1660. came to the Houſe of Lords, and ſigned fourteen private, and eight publick Acts, among which one was an Act for the Confirming and Reſtoring of Miniſters. This Act ſtopt the clamours of many Eccleſiaſtical Perſons that had defective titles to their Cures: and the goodneſs of His Majeſty was very much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by His conſent to it. It enacts, That every Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Miniſter, ordained by any Eccleſiaſtical Perſons before the twenty fifth of <hi>December</hi> laſt paſt, and was then in poſſeſſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the profits, being in the King's gift, or of His Father, or of any Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Dean and Chapter, Prebend, Archdeacon, Body Politick or Corporate, or other Perſon, other than ſuch hereby reſtored, is declared lawful Incumbent.</p>
               <p>Every Voluntary Reſignation of a Benefice to the Patron, or any Pretended Power ſince the ſaid firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> to be good, as if made to the Competent Ordinary.</p>
               <p>No preſentation is to be conſtrued to be an uſurpation in Law, to the prejudice of any that ſhall have right to preſent.</p>

               <p>On <hi>December</hi> 29. following, on which day the Parliament was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 32 Acts more were paſſed by the King. Among which one was an Act for Confirmation of Marriages during the time of the late Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. Another was for making the Precinct of <hi>Covent-garden</hi> Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial. And an Act for the diſappropriating of the Rectory appropriate of <hi>Preſton,</hi> and uniting and conſolidating of the ſaid Rectory, and of the Vicarage of the Church of <hi>Preſton,</hi> and for the aſſuring of the Advou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and right of Patronage of the ſame unto the Maſter, Fellows, and Scholars of <hi>Immanuel-colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And an Act for Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grants and Leaſes from Colledges and Hoſpitals.</p>
               <p>Now ſome ſixty Fifth-monarchy men under the conduct of one <hi>Thomas Venner,</hi> a Cooper, broke forth into Rebellion. This <hi>Venner</hi> was a Preacher to a Conventicle of that opinion in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Such was the madneſs of theſe men, that they believed, that They and the reſt of their judgement were called by God to reform the world, and make all the earthly powers (which they called <hi>Babylon)</hi> ſubſervient
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53424:196"/> to the Kingdom of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and in Order thereunto never to ſheath their ſwords, till the carnal powers of the world were ſubdued. They were taught and believed, that one of them ſhould ſubdue a Thouſand, making account when they had done their work in <hi>England,</hi> to go into <hi>France, Spain, Germany,</hi> and other parts of the world, there to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their pretended holy deſign. The place where they plotted and continued their conſpiracy was the meeting-place for their devotion, and thither they had at ſeveral times convayed arms. On Sunday <hi>January</hi> 6. which was the day before their excurſion, they were very late at their Aſſembly, which made one <hi>Martin,</hi> the Landlord of the Houſe, inquiſitive after their doings. He peeping through a chink in their door, ſaw them arming themſelves with Back, breaſt, and head-piece, and thereupon immediately gave notice to the next Officers. Half an hour after they came down, and firſt marched to S. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, to call ſome of their party, from thence to <hi>Biſhops-gate,</hi> and after to <hi>White-croſs-ſtreet.</hi> They eſcaped to S. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Wood,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Canc-wood,</hi> betwixt <hi>High-gate</hi> and <hi>Hampſted.</hi> On <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning the Rebels came again into <hi>London,</hi> and divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into two parties, one whereof about five or ſix in the morning appeared about <hi>Leaden-hall,</hi> and from thence marched to little <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheap,</hi> where they fought deſperately, but were diſperſed by the trained bands. <hi>Venner,</hi> and another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They fought with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable courage, and if they had not been hindred from encreaſing their numbers, a Thouſand men ſo reſolved might have done much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. <hi>Venner</hi> himſelf was much wounded before he was taken, and about five or ſix were killed that refuſed quarter.

               </p>
               <p>About this time there was a conference at the <hi>Savoy</hi> between divers Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Divines about the Church diſcipline, but to little effect.</p>
               <p>A new Parliament was called, which aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter, May</hi> 8. 1661. In the firſt Seſſion whereof an Act was paſſed, Entitled, <hi>An Act for diſenabling all Perſons in Holy Orders to exerciſe any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral juriſdiction or Authority,</hi> Repealed. The Biſhops were brought to ſit again as Peers in the Houſe of Lords, and their Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction reſtored to them.</p>
               <p>The Parliament explained a clauſe contained in an Act of Parliament, made in the ſeventeenth year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, Entitled, <hi>An Act for Repeal of a branch of a Statute</hi> Primo Elizabethae, <hi>concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for cauſes Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>

               <p>At the ſecond Seſſion of this Parliament, an Act was made againſt Quakers, and others, denying to take a Lawful Oath, with ſeveral penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be inflicted on them for ſeveral offences.</p>
               <p>An Act was alſo paſſed for Uniformity of publick Prayers, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremonies; and of ordering, and conſecrating Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THe Inſtallation of Biſhops was a Ceremony of great ſolemnity in former Ages, the particularity whereof we find in <hi>Walter Stapleton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, who was Conſecrated <hi>March</hi> 18. 1307.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Exceſter</hi> to be Inſtalled, at the Eaſt-gate he alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Horſe, and went on foot to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. All the way, where he ſhould paſs, being laid and covered with black Cloath, on each hand he was conducted by a Gentleman of great worſhip, Sir <hi>Hugh Courtney</hi> (who claimed to be Steward of his Feaſt) going next before him. At Broad-gate he was received by his Chapter and Quire in their Ornaments, with <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and ſo carried into the Church.</p>
               <p>The uſual Ceremonies being performed there, at his Palace a great Feaſt was prepared for the entertainment of ſuch Noble-men, and other Perſons of account, as repaired thither at that time. It is incredible, how many Oxen, Tuns of Ale and Wine are ſaid to have been uſually ſpent at this kind of Solemnity, even ſo much as the whole yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, at this time, would not ſuffice to pay for.</p>

                  <p>HEre it will be neceſſary to premiſe, what was the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Monks and Friars.

Indeed they had houſes or cells to dwell in, or rather to hide themſelves in, but they had no means thereunto belonging.</p>
                  <p>But it may be Objected, That many Convents of Friars had large and ample Revenues, amounting to ſome hundreds (though never thouſands) by the year.
